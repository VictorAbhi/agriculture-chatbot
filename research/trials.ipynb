Vegetable crops are\\nmore susceptible to diseases as compared to other crops. Various biotic factors like fungi, bacteria, viruses,\\nphytoplasmas and nematodes are responsible for causing diseases in vegetables that result severe losses in\\nyield and quality. In recent past, introduction of hybrids of vegetables created new disease problems with\\nincreased disease intensity. Disease pressure in the standing crop and spoilage caused by fungi and bacteria\\nduring transit, storage and marketing are the main business constraints of vegetable produce. Approximately\\n65 million tones pre-harvest losses in vegetables due to disease alone in the world has been estimated that\\naccounts about 10.5 percent of the total produce of vegetables. Pre-harvest loss means, the produce either\\nnever produced because of indirect interference of pathogen in host physiology or directly destroyed by disease\\nbefore harvesting.  Post-harvest losses are equally important because most of the vegetables are highly\\nperishable in nature and easily colonized by the microorganisms. The fungicides in addition to non-target\\neffects are becoming expensive year after year and losing their effectiveness due to development of resistance\\nin pathogen strains. Most of the new generation pesticides are systemic in nature which leads to certain level\\nof toxicity in the plant system and affecting health hazards.  Further, it disturbs complete ecology of the microbial\\ndiversity of whole ecosystem.\\nDisease scenario in vegetable crops has changed due to extensive use of exotic hybrids, intensive and\\nmonoculture of vegetables. Disease pressure of soil-borne pathogens like Pythium, Sclerotinia, Rhizoctonia,\\nFusarium and Sclerotium are increasing and engulfing almost all vegetable crops causing very severe crop loss\\nevery year. Virus associated diseases caused by cucumber mosaic virus, tospovirus, begomovirus, potyvirus\\nand illarvirus in vegetables caused huge losses every year to different vegetable crops. Recently, phytoplasma\\ndiseases are also emerging as very important diseases in many vegetable crops and causing significant economic\\nlosses. Soil borne bacterial pathogen, Ralstonia causes wilt disease in solanaceous vegetables is responsible to\\nshift of cropping pattern in a locality.  The off-season vegetable growing practices have prolonged the survival\\nperiod of pathogens in the field. The problem of seed-borne diseases like black rot of cole crops, bacterial\\nblight of tomato and cucumber mosaic virus in cucurbits and their inoculum has increased throughout the\\ncountry.\\nOpen General License (OGL) and General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) agreement results in an easy\\nimport policy of vegetable seeds from other countries. Free movement of susceptible seeds and planting\\nmaterials by private seed companies, scientists and farmers has been observed throughout the country without\\nproper domestic quarantine regulations. Multinational vegetable seed companies have been easily importing\\nthe seeds and susceptible planting materials from different countries, which further increased disease pressure\\nand their inoculum in vegetables. All these factors have led to new dimension in research for diseases in\\nvegetable crops.

Control means absolute check of a disease,\\nwhich is neither true nor possible. No pathogen is completely eradicated from a natural ecosystem but only its\\npopulation can be minimized up to economic injury level. Disease management does not employ against the\\nonly pathogen but also considers the other two components of disease triangle i.e. host and the environment\\nthat gives the whole concept of integrated disease management (IDM). The main objective of IDM is to manage\\nthe losses below an economic injury level and minimize the recurrence of a disease by interrupting in the\\ndisease cycle. Integrated management practices should be planned in such a way in the normal cultural practices\\nthat may be effective against more than one disease. Integrated disease management lies in pathogen, host,\\ntime, and environment. Pathogen management involves reduction in inoculum, eradication, and prevention\\nof inoculum while management of host involves improving plant vigor, inducing resistance through nutrition\\nand genetic manipulation and protection by chemical means. The time factor could be managed by adjustment\\nof sowing/planting date so that favorable time of disease should not coincide without any adverse effect on\\nyield. Management of environments involves water, soil and crop management. The principles of IDM are\\nbased on avoidance, exclusion, eradication, protection, and host resistance. Avoiding disease by planting at\\ntimes when or in areas where inoculum is ineffective due to environmental conditions. It could be also achieved\\nby selecting geographic area for disease free seed production, using disease escaping varieties, selection of\\ndisease-free seeds and modification of cultural practices. Sowing of okra up to first week of July is effective in\\nmanaging Cercospora leaf blight of okra. Summer crop of cucumber is almost free from downy mildew. Exclusion\\nmeans preventing the inoculum from entering or establishing in the field or area where it does not exit. Seed\\ncertification, seed treatment, plant quarantine and eradic ation of insect vectors are effective methods to\\ncheck disease spread. Eradication is applied when pathogen has already been entered in area or crop despite\\nthe above-mentioned precautions. At this condition, biological control methods, crop rotation, rouging,\\neradication of alternate and collateral hosts, sanitation, soil treatments, heat and chemical treatments of\\ndiseased plants can be applied. Crop rotation with cereals and fallowing is quite effective to reduce incidence\\nof root knot nematode, wilt of pea, S. rolfsii  and Verticillium dahliae . Composted municipal sludge when\\nincorporated in the soil at high rate (10%w/w) reduces Aphanomyces root rot of pea, Rhizoctonia root rot of\\nbean and radish, Fusarium wilt of cucumber and Phytophthora crown rot of pepper.  Protecting infection by\\ncreating a chemical toxic barrier between the plant surface and the pathogen is very much applicable for\\nchecking secondary inoculum and infection for those diseases, which have very high infection rate. It includes\\nchemical spray on the diseased plants and for insect vectors, use of barrier and trap crops. Host resistance is\\nthe best method of disease management where moderately resistant and tolerant lines can be developed\\nwith great success without reducing qualitative and quantitative yield attributes.\\nOpen General License (OGL) and General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) agreement results in an easy\\nimport policy of vegetable seeds from other countries. Free movement of susceptible seeds and planting\\nmaterials by private seed companies, scientists and farmers has been observed throughout the country without\\nproper domestic quarantine regulations. Multinational vegetable seed companies have been easily importing\\nthe seeds and susceptible planting materials from different countries, which further increased disease pressure\\nand their inoculum in vegetables. All these factors have led to new dimension in research for diseases in\\nvegetable crops.

The word “tomato” is derived from the Nahuatl word tomatl. The probable\\ncentre of origin of wild tomato is South America and it was domesticated in pre-Columbian Mexico. Tomato\\ncrop ranks second in the world vegetable production after potato and ranks third in India after potato and\\nonion. The major tomato growing nations include China, India, Italy, USA, Turkey, and Egypt. The total worldwide\\nproduction of tomato is 163.96 million tonnes per annum (FAO, 2016). India ranks second in total production\\nafter China. In India, the major tomato growing states include Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka,\\nOrissa, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Assam.\\nTomato is one of the widely cultivated vegetable of India. It is an important vegetable crop regarding nutrition\\nand income. Tomatoes fruits are utilized as fresh fruits, eaten raw in salads, or as cooked vegetables. A large\\nproportion of tomato crop is utilized as processed products such as canned tomatoes, ketchup, soups, sauces,\\ntomato juice, puree, chutneys, paste, pickles, dehydrated pulp etc. Tomatoes are nutritionally rich as they are\\na good source of vitamin C, A, B complex, potassium, minerals like calcium, sodium and organic acids viz.,\\nacetic, formic and citric acids. The attractive red colour of the fruit is due to presence of pigment viz. lycopene.\\nTomato is considered as good appetizer and acts as good remedy for prevention of constipation.\\nTomato is a warm-season crop but can be grown throughout the year under greenhouse conditions. It grows\\nwell at an average temperature of 21 to 23\\n0C. Heavy rainfall and prolonged dry spell exhibits detrimental effect\\non growth and fruit development. The overall production and productivity of tomato crop is hindered by a\\nnumber of diseases, insect-pests and physiological disorders. Among all these, fungal diseases are a major\\nlimiting factor in tomato production. The major diseases affecting tomato production are damping off, collar\\nrot, late blight and early blight.\\nName of disease: DAMPING OFF\\nGeographical origin, distribution and crop losses: The term ‘Damping-off’ is coined during the early nineteenth\\ncentury, and it represents one of the oldest nursery problems worldwide and the term is generally used for the\\ndeath of seedlings, either before or after emergence from the soil. It is one of the most serious problems faced\\nby the farmers in raising tomato seedlings in nursery beds. Damping off may affect 5 to 80 per cent of the\\ntomato seedlings, thereby causing huge economic loss to the farmers (Lamichhaneet al. 2017). Many farmers\\ndepend on producing early tomatoes for the market to capture profit but due to the disease there is a set-back\\nof one or two weeks which usually does not reduce the yield, but it greatly reduces the net returns, because of\\nthe low price of late tomatoes. The additional cost of replanting also results in huge economic loss.\\nTomato\\n1'),\n",

In\\ngeneral, random patches of poor seedling emergence are the indication of\\npre-emergence damping off (\\nFig. 1).\\nPost-emergence damping-off:  In case of post- emergence damping-off,\\nseedlings decay, wilt, topple down on the nursery bed occurs and the\\nseedlings ultimately die just after emergence. The hypocotyl of the seedling becomes water soaked, discolored\\nat the surface of the soil, stems become thin, turns gray, brown or black after emergence. If the plants survived,\\nthe hypocotyl and roots remain infected and the surviving plants show stunted growth, and affected areas\\noften show uneven patches of plant growth.\\nCausal organism\\nDamping-off is caused by several soil-borne fungi including Pythium, Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia and Fusarium.\\nKey Characteristics: Pythium is a parasitic oomycete characterized by coenocytic hyphae without septations.\\nPhytophthora produces coenocytic, multinucleate mycelium and the sporangia are hyaline, lemon shaped\\nwith a distinct papilla at the distal end and borne singly at the tip of alternately branched sporangiophores.\\nRhizoctonia belongs to the class Deuteromycetes which can survive as mycelium, sclerotia or basidiospores.\\nFungus is characterized by the structure of hyphae with a constriction at the point of branching and right\\nangles of the hyphae.  Fusarium produces extensive cotton like mycelium in culture, conidiophores variable,\\nslender, branched irregularly or bearing a whorl of phialids, single or grouped into sporodochia; conidia hyaline,\\nprincipally of two kinds, macroconidia are several celled, slightly curved at the pointed ends; microconidia 1 –\\ncelled, ovoid or oblong, borne singly or in chains.\\nDisease cycle and Favourable conditions\\nThe pathogens survived or spread primarily by soil, seed and water and secondarily by conidia through rain or\\nwind. The infection is most common in cool conditions, but Phytophthora and Rhizoctonia can infect seedlings\\nin warmer soils also. As and when tomato seedlings reach the 2 to 3 leaf stage, they are no longer susceptible\\nto the infection by Pythium or Rhizoctonia but Phytophthora can infect tomato plants at any stage of the growth.\\nThe disease is favoured by high humidity, poor soil drainage resulting in wetness of soil, low soil temperature,\\ncloudiness and low temperatures below 24° C continuously for few days. Crowded seedlings also hamper\\nplant growth and increase the disease.\\nManagement\\nDamping-off management requires an integrated disease management (IDM) approach combining both\\npreventive and curative management approaches.\\nAvoidance: Damping-off can be avoided by sowing seeds in w ell-drained, well-prepared raised seed bed;\\navoiding overcrowding, excessive shade, over watering, or over fertilization or by transplanting disease free\\nseedlings.

CRC Press.\\nName of disease: EARLY BLIGHT\\nGeographical origin, distribution and crop losses:  Early blight is one of the most common disease of tomato\\ndistributed throughout the world. It is considered as weed of tomato field due to its wide adaptability under\\nvarious climatic conditions. However, it is more destructive in tropical and subtropical regions. It was reported\\nthat 1% increase in the intensity of the disease can cause decline in yield by 1.36% and complete failure of crop\\nmay occur under severe conditions (Pandey et al., 2003).\\nSymptoms: Tomato is affected by two species of Alternaria. Early blight of tomato is caused by Alternaria\\nsolani with 40-45% average incidence. This is most destructive disease and prevalent all over the country. The\\nyield loss was recorded 80-86% in experimental field due to early blight alone. A. alternata f.sp. lycopersici is\\nanother species causing leaf blight with 10-15% average incidence ev ery year.  Irregular leaf spots mostly\\nappear from marginal portion of leaves.  These lesions are having prominent yellowing on their outer margin\\ndue to host specific AAL toxin produced by the pathogen. Mostly disease appears in vegetative phase of plant\\ngrowth before flowering. Symptoms of early blight appe ar on all above ground parts of the plant. Leaf spot\\nsymptoms are scattered, brown with concentric rings like a target board and often with chlorotic halo (\\nFig. 2).\\nIn humid weather, the spots coalesced and enlarged.  Girdling of the stem at the base of the seedlings and\\nplant can be seen. The stem lesions are usually restricted to one side of a stem and become elongated and\\nFig.2 Early blight of tomato Fig.3 Symptoms of early blight on tomato\\nfruits'),\n",

Primary infection occurs on blossoms. Fruit symptoms initiate from calyx and pedicels. Gradually, it\\nprogresses on apical portion of fruit (stem-end) as a spot and radiate out from the attachment between calyx\\nand fruit.  Fruit spots are dark brown, depressed firm and with distinct concentric rings (Fig.3). The pathogen\\nis soil borne as well as seed borne in nature.\\nCausal organism: Alternaria solani\\nKey characteristics: The pathogen produces septate and darkly pigmented mycelium which darkens with age.\\nThe conidia are borne on distinct conidiophores singly or in a chain of two. The conidia are usually long beaked\\nbearing 9-11 transverse septae. The isolates of the pathogen produces diffusible yellowish to reddish pigments\\non potato dextrose agar media.\\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions: The pathogen primarily overwinters on infected crop debris. Thick\\nwalled resistant spore i.e., chlamydospores have also been reported but occur infrequently. Under mild climatic\\nconditions, the pathogen thrives on volunteer potato, tomato plants as well as other wild solanaceous plants\\nviz., nightshade and horsenettle. Secondary spread of the disease occurs from airborne conidia dispersed\\nmainly by wind and occasionally by rain splash and overhead irrigation.\\nThe optimum temperature of 24-29\\n°C and high relative humidity are conducive for the infection. The conidia\\ngerminates at an optimum temperature of 28-30°C in presence of free moisture. Desiccated germ tube possess\\nability to renew their growth upon rewetting. Thus, infection may occur under alternating dry and wet conditions\\nand the pathogen penetrates the leaf either directly or through stomata. The incubation period of the pathogen\\ndepends on several factors such as leaf age, susceptibility of cultivars and environmental conditions. Early\\nblight disease occurs primarily on aging plant parts. Sporulation requires a long wet period but can also be\\ninduced under alternating dry and wet conditions. Condiophores emerge during wet night followed by day\\nlight and dry conditions induce spore formation, which are produced on second wet night.\\nManagement\\nResistant cultivars: A number of varieties having considerable resistance to early blight disease have been\\nreleased for commercial use. However, completely resista nt varieties still does not exist. Young plants are\\nrelatively resistant to the disease and susceptibility increases at maturity after fruit initiation.\\nCultural practices: Good cultural practices play an important role in maintaining plants health while reducing\\nthe losses caused by early blight disease below economic threshold level. Transplant tomato seedlings on\\nbeds covered with plastic mulch which not only maintain soil moisture, reduce evapotranspitation and maintain\\nlow relative humidity in microclimate of crop canopy. Field sanitation plays a key role in reducing the initial\\ninoculum of the pathogen as pathogen thrives on infect ed plant debris. Infected plant debris and decaying\\nfruits should be removed from the field. Collateral hosts of solanaceous family viz., weeds and volunteer\\nplants should be removed from the field prior to planting of crop. Crop rotation with non-host crop also\\nreduces inoculum buildup. Irrigation should be avoided during cloudy weather or in the evening. Soil fertility\\nplays an important role in disease management. The dise ase occurs in nitrogen deficient soil towards the\\nmaturity stage of the crop. Thus, optimum nutrition level in soil reduces plant stress and enhances plant\\nhealth.\\nChemical control:  Fungicides having protectant and curative properties are effective in early blight disease\\nmanagement. Fungicides such as fluxapyroxad, flupyram and penthiopyrad can be effectively controlled the\\ndisease. Timing of application relative to environmental conditions and potential for disease development is\\ncrucial.

The pathogen  Phytophthora\\ninfestans probably originated from central Mexico. The disease was introduced into United States from Mexico\\nand it further spread to North America and Europe. During subsequent decades, the disease appeared\\nthroughout the world and was widely distributed in the twentieth century. Phytophthora infestans is known\\nto attack several plant species belonging to family Solanaceae and can cause complete devastation of tomato\\nand potato crop. In 2009, the late blight disease appeared in epidemic form in US caused due to rapid\\ndissemination of pathogen on infected tomato transplants (Hu et al., 2012).\\nSymptoms: The disease is caused by Phytophthora infestans and is more common in North West states.

Green and ripe fruit affected by the\\nblight appeared as greenish brown and internal tissues become spongy with bad odor.\\nCausal organism: Phytophthora infestans\\nKey Characteristics:  The pathogen Phytophthora infestans produces coenocytic, multinucleate mycelium\\nalthough septation is seen in old cultures in vitro. The asexual spores known as sporangia are borne singly at\\nthe tip of alternately branched sporangiophores. The char acteristic feature include s alternately branched\\nsporangiophores with swelling at the point of attachment of sporangia. The sporangia produced are hyaline,\\nlemon shaped with a distinct papilla at the distal end. The pathogen is heterothallic in nature as it requires A1\\nand A2 compatibility types for production of oospores which is rare.\\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions\\nThe fungus Phytophthora infestans thrives on infected plants and tomato fruit as dormant mycelium. The\\nvolunteer tomato plants, infected fruits left in the field during harvest acts as source of primary inoculum. The\\nsecondary spread of the disease occurs through air borne condia.\\nThe growth of pathogen is favoured under cool, wet and cloudy weather conditions as clouds protect the\\nspores from UV radiation exposure and high moisture content on the leaf surface allows germination of spores\\nand subsequent infection. Optimum temperature of 60-80 0Fand high relative humidity (90%) are perquisite\\nfor disease initiation. The disease can also appear under warm day temperature (95 0F) with moderate night\\ntemperatures (60-750F). Sporangia may germinate directly via germ tube development at 70-79 0 F. At lower\\ntemperature, below 650F sporangia germinates by production of zoospores. Zoospores require moisture for\\nswimming and dispersal and capable of initiating new infection.\\nManagement\\nCrop rotation: Rotation of tomato crops with non-host crops for duration of two to three years is essential for\\nmanagement of late blight disease.\\nElimination of overwintering inoculums : Field sanitation is the preliminary step in controlling tomato late\\nblight disease. The infected plants, plant debris, fruits and volunteer plants should be removed and destroyed\\nto reduce the inoculum density.\\nScouting for disease: Regular scouting of fields is essential for the growers to detect early disease onset and to\\nprevent disease occurrence in severe form. It alerts the growers of potential disease outbreak.\\nFungicides application: Application of fungicides is the last resort for management of late blight disease in\\nhumid areas. Contact fungicides are more effective in disease management without development of resistant\\npathotypes.

The disease is distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions and warm temperate regions of\\nCentral, North, and South America, Australia, Southern Europe,\\nAfrica, Asia, and Hawaii. It occurs in diverse soils and has a very\\nwide host range. Thiribhuvanamala et al. (1999) reported that the\\ndisease causes 30 per cent yield loss in tomato crop. The first report\\nof this fungus Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc dates back to 1892 with Peter\\nHenry Rolfs’ discovery of the organism in association with tomato\\nblight in Florida. After that different publications on this pathogen\\nsupport evidence of its worldwide distribution.\\nSymptoms: The first symptom of disease is observed as soft tissue\\nnecrosis of bark of the stem near soil line. White, cottony and silvery\\nmycelium growth is clearly visible on the affected portion. Fungal\\ngrowth is also found just below the soil surface. Later on, white to\\nlight brown mustard like sclerotia is observed on the same portion.\\nProgressive dropping and yellowing followed by wilting of the entire\\nplant is observed (Fig. 6). Sometime plants collapse soon after\\ninfection. The disease is soil borne where pathogen survives in the form of sclerotia.\\nCausal organism: Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc\\nKey characteristics: S. rolfsii is necrotrophic, soil borne fungal phytopathogen that produces abundant white\\nmycelium on infected plants and in culture. The fungus is characterized by the production of small, tan to dark\\nbrown or black spherical sclerotia of average diameter of 0.6 mm comprising three layers – outer rind, middle\\ncortex and inner medulla. Mature sclerotia are hard, slightly pitted, and have a distinct rind. Although most\\nsclerotia are spherical, some are slightly flattened. S. rolfsii does not form asexual fruiting structures or spores.\\nThe teliomorph of S. rolfsii (Athelia rolfsii) is rarely observed on hosts or in culture.\\nDisease cycle and Favorable conditions\\nThe collar rot disease is typically a seed-bed disease which attacks young, tender plants in the seed bed that\\nultimately carries the disease to the main field. The infection is favored by high moisture, high temperature,\\nhigh humidity, and moderate to heavy rainfall. The temperature requirement for hyphal extension and dry\\nweight production of S. rolfsii is 8-40°C and maximum growth and scleria formation occur at 27-30°C. The\\nfungus can survive in soil for more than four years in the form of dormant sclerotia. Due to its extensive host\\nrange and sclerotial survival in soil for a long time makes it very difficult to control.\\nFig. 6. Rotting of stem due to collar rot\\ncaused by Sclerotium rolfsii'),\n",

Crop rotation for 2-3 years with non-susceptible crops\\nsuch as maize and small grains can reduce the disease. As a common cultural practice, removal of infected\\nplants is an important aspect of Sclerotial disease management.

Mycelium of the fungus is hyaline, much branched\\nconsisting of closely septate latrge hypahe which are both intra and inter cellular. The hyphae are 9-18 µm\\nbroad and filled with dense protoplasm. The fungus does not produce true conidia. Micro conidia (spermatia)\\nmay be produced during shortage of food supply on the disc of over mature apothecia. After completion of\\nvegetative growth, the hypahe with thick granular protoplasm and short cells collect in small dense masses\\nwhich gradually become sclerotia. Sclerotia are initially pink in color and turns dark brown to black on\\nmaturity with a dimension of 2.5-6 mm (Singh, 2004).\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: The fungus survives through sclerotia on the soil surface or in the\\ncrop debris or as admixture of seed during the off sea son. The primary infection takes place by ascospore\\nproduced from germination of these sclerotia. Wind borne ascospores, soil in the rhizosphere region of\\nseedlings, farm machineries, animals and humans are the primary means of spread of the disease. Farm animal\\nfeed on the contaminated crop along with the sclerotia may also spread the disease by means of dung (Alkem\\nand Melouk, 1990). The sclerotia can also undergo a hyphal or eruptive mycelial germination. In hyphal\\ngermination, production of a few short hyphal strands are observed. These hyphal strands can colonize on\\ndead plant materials which come in contact with them. Using the colonized material as food source, the fungus\\ncan infect healthy host tissue. In eruptive mycelial germination, production of a massive and dense mycelium\\nis observed. The mycelium can directly infect health y host tissue. In both the process, more sclerotia are\\nproduced within a short period after infection, thus completing the cycle. Epidemics are initiated by ascospore\\ndeveloped from sclerotia during mid-winter. Clarkson et al., (2003) have reported that release of ascospores\\noccur in both saturated air (90-95% RH) and at 65-75% RH. The favorable temperature for germination of\\nascospore is 15-30\\n0C. However, 100% germination is observed in the temperature of 20-250C.\\nManagement\\nCultural:\\n• Seed must be free from sclerotia and seed infection. If sclerotia are observed in the seed lot, these should\\nbe removed with floatation. Seed borne mycelium can be inactivated by seed treatment with fungicide\\nlike iprodione + thiram.

It is a fungus that\\nthrives in warm, wet conditions and lives in the soil. It is characterized by a bull’s eye pattern of dark brown\\nrotting on the tomato fruit, and affects fruit that is close to, or lying on the soil. The easiest management is to\\nkeep the plant out of contact with the soil, although other chemical methods can be very effective.\\nThis disease commonly occurs in the southeast and south-central ar eas of the United States. The disease has\\naffected a large portion of crop yield in the United States as well as India. The relatively small genome size\\nof Phytophthora parasitica compared to Phytophthora infestans gives researchers the unique ability to further\\nexamine its ability to cause disease. Besides Phytophthora other pathogen like Colletotrichum coccodes is alo\\ninvolved in this disease.\\nSymptoms: Symptom of Myrothecium fruit rot on green as well as ripe fruit appeared as water-soaked rotting\\nwith prominent concentric zonation.  White to black numerous sporodochia was observed on each ring of\\nrotting.  Rhizoctonia fruit rot is most serious disease of kharif tomato. Symptoms appear as rhythmic rotting of\\nfruits coming with the soil contact.  Rotting is immediately followed by cracking and fungal growth over it (\\nFig\\n9). Buckeye fruit rot caused by Phytophthora parasitica was observed mostly in green fruits. Symptoms of ripe\\nfruit rot caused by Colletotrichum coccodes were first time observed in 2002-2003 as black, dry and corky\\nrotting with acervuli over it ( Fig. 10 ).  Sclerotium fruit rot is very clear due to white fungal mycelium and\\nmustard grain like sclerotia over fruits (Fig 11). Sclerotinia fruit rot is having bigger and irregular sclerotia over\\nit.

The fungi are\\nspread by surface water, spattering rain, and furrow irrigation. While it can sexually reproduce through the\\nproduction of oospores, its primary form of reproduction is by asexually producing sporangia. These sporangia\\nare found at the tips of sporangiophores that emerge through the stomates. Sporangia release zoospores which\\nrequire water for transport. Zoospores swim in water droplets until they encyst and infect the fruit. Symptoms,\\nbeginning with fruit rot, may form within 24 hours. Chlamydospores are the pathogen’s resting structure,\\nwhich allows the disease to survive and overwinter in the soil. The chlamydospores germinate in soil or decaying\\ndebris. Through these chlamydospores, the pathogen begins the disease cycle again. The combination of asexual\\nand sexual spores makes this disease polycyclic, therefore it can infect multiple times throughout a season.\\nManagement\\nCultural:\\n• Maintain proper soil moisture.\\n• Avoid the contact of fruit from soil by staking of plant.\\n• Provide proper drainage in the field.\\nChemical control :\\n• Apply fungicides containing mefenoxam to the soil surface under the vines around 4–8 weeks prior to\\nharvest.\\n• Soil should be fumigated before anything else is planted in previously-infected soil.\\nBiological:\\nGreen manuring followed by soil application of Trichoderma @5 kg/ha in soil is very effective in checking most\\nof the fruit rotting.

Currently, this\\ndisease remains one of the most destructive diseases of tomato in the\\nsoutheastern United States. The disease mainly attacks tomato leaves at\\nall growth stages from seedling to harvest. On susceptible cultivars, the\\ndisease can cause significant early defoliation, which leads tomato fruit\\nprone to sunscald. The pathogen also infects pepper, eggplant, potato,\\nand some solanaceous weeds. Stemphylium solani is found throughout\\nthe world. It was first by described by George Weber in 1930 in Florida, United States. It has since been reported\\nin Brazil, Venezuela, India, South Africa, Spain, Australia, Egypt, and China.\\nSymptoms: Small circular dark brown necrotic, numerous spots appeared all over the leaf lamina that is\\nuniformly distributed on entire foliage ( Fig. 13 ). Sometime clear narrow yellow halo is visible around the\\nspots. Usually these spots are isolated but in later stage they coalesced to each other . Severely infected older\\nleaves blighted and fall. Small elongated to circular lesions appeared on stem after brightening of leaves.\\nCausal organism: This disease is very common during winter and caused by Stemphillium solani.\\nKey characteristics: Colonies are with typical septate mycelium with the young hyphae subhyaline and gradually\\nbecame greyish green to dark brown with age. Conidiophores are subhyaline to light brown, 3- to 10-septate,\\nup to 200 µm in length, and 4 to 7 µm in width, with apical cell slightly to distinctly swollen, bearing a single\\nspore at the apex. Conidia were muriform, mostly oblong to ovoid, but occasionally nearly globose, subhyline\\nto variant shades of brown, mostly constricted at the median septum, 22.6 ± 6.22 (11.9 to 36.9) µm in length,\\nand 15.1 ± 2.85 (8.3 to 22.6) µm in width, with 1 to 8 transverse and 0 to 5 longitudinal septa. \\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions: Three fungal species in the genus Stemphylium, S. lycopersici, S.\\nbotryosum sp. lycopersici and S. solani, have been reported to cause gray leaf spot of tomato. The pathogen\\nsurvives in plant debris and can be seedborne. In the region where tomato is grown throughout the year, the\\npathogen can remain viable on living tomato plants. An epidemic of the disease may begin in infested seedbeds.\\nInfected tomato seedlings, plant debris and volunteer pepper, eggplant and other wild solanaceous can serve\\nas inoculum sources for disease epidemics in fields. Fungal spores can be dispersed by wind or air circulation,\\nand by splashing water resulted from rainfall and overhead irritation. Spore germination and infection require\\nhigh humidity or free water on leaf surfaces. The optimal temperature for the disease development is 77 °F.\\nSo, the disease is favored by warm and wet weather conditions.\\nManagement\\nCultural:\\n• Use of resistant varieties is an effective and economic way to control this disease.\\n• Removal and burning of all crop debris after senescence of the crop.\\n•  Periodical monitoring of the crop for initiation of disease from last fortnight of December to first week of\\nJanuary.\\n• Rotate tomato with non-solanaceous crops for 2-3 years.\\nFig. 13.

Disease\\ncontinues from July to October. Prominent yellow halo\\nis observed around the spot.\\nSymptoms: Small, dark spots appear on leaflets and\\nstems of seedlings transplanted crop (Fig. 14). Numerous\\nspots coalesced and cause severe burning of the leaves.  The most conspicuous and damaging phase is infection\\nof immature fruits.  Small water-soaked spots appear on exposed surfaces of the green and turning red fruits.\\nThese are slightly raised and corky in appearance (\\nFig. 15).\\nCausal organism: Bacterial spot of tomato is caused by Xanthomonas vesicatoria.\\nKey characteristics: The bacteria that cause bacterial spot are called xanthomonads. Recent taxonomic studies\\nhave indicated that these bacteria belong to one of four groups: A, B, C and D. The original (and still valid),\\ntaxonomic name given to these bacteria was Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, but recent work has\\nindicated that each group may represent a separate species. It is a Gram-negative and rod-shaped. It causes\\nsymptoms throughout the above-ground portion of the plant including leaf spots, fruit spots and stem cankers.\\nSince this bacterium cannot live in soil for more than a few weeks and survives as inoculum on plant debris,\\nremoval of dead plant material and chemical applications to  living plants are considered effective control\\nmechanisms.\\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions:\\nXanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria survives on tomato and pepper plants, seeds, and debris from infected\\nplants as it cannot live in the soil for more than a few weeks. The bacterium can also be found in association\\nwith wheat roots and some weed species which are both considered sources of inoculum as well as diseased\\ntomato and pepper plants. In cold climates, Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria infection is mostly caused\\nby contaminated seed material, both on and inside of seeds. If it survives on seeds, it will infect the cotyledons\\nof the growing plant as it emerges from the seed coa t. Internally infected seeds will produce diseased plants\\nfrom the point of germination. Systemic symptoms such as wilting, yellowing, and dwarfing are not typical of\\nplants infected at the point of germination. Howeve r, foliage loss can happen when localized symptoms on\\nleaves become severe. If the bacterium survives on debris, it may infect healthy plants through stomata as\\nwell as wounds on leaves and fruit. It is spread by direct contact of plants with debris, human movement of the\\nbacteria from debris to plants, and can easily travel from debris to healthy plants through saturated soils via\\nwater movement. Once infected, plants begin to develop lesions on the leaves as well as fruit, becoming\\ninoculum sources for further infection.\\nDisease appeared in rainy season and continued up to fruit initiation stage.  The disease is prevalent in warm\\nhumid weather when RH is more than 90% and temperature is between 25 and 35\\noC.\\nFig. 14.

Symptoms are very difficult to\\nvisually distinguish from bacterial spot and can be confused with young, early blight lesions. On leaves, symptoms\\nappear as black specks, usually no more than 2 mm in diameter, which are usually surrounded by a yellow\\nhalo. Speck lesions sometimes cause distortion of the leaf, as the infection restricts the expansion of leaf\\ntissue. Lesions are often concentrated near leaf edges, and in some cases, leaf margin burn resembling bacterial\\ncanker may occur. When numerous, lesions may coalesce, and entire leaflets may die. Severely infected seedlings\\nmay become stunted. Only green fruit less than 3 cm in diameter is susceptible to infection by the bacterial\\nspeck pathogen. Small (less than 1-3 mm), slightly raised black specks develop and are often surrounded by a\\nnarrow green to yellow halo. Lesions are usually superficial and can be scraped off with a fingernail. Red fruit\\nare not susceptible to infection, likely due to a lack of entry points for bacteria; fruit hairs, which may break\\nand allow bacteria to enter, are only present on young fruit. On fruit previously infected, black lesions remain\\nafter ripening.\\nCausal organism:  The disease is almost similar to bacterial spot but caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv.\\ntomato.\\nKey characteristics: Pseudomonas syringae is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacterium with polar flagella.

In general, however, tospovirus symptoms appear as chlorotic or necrotic\\nrings, lines, or spots on leaves, stems, and fruits, necrotic streaks on stems; bronzing, curling, and wilting of\\nleaves; rings, necrotic spots, and malformations on fruits; stunting and necrosis of parts or whole plants; and,\\ngenerally, greatly reduced yields.\\nCausal agent: Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV)\\nKey Characteristics: The tospovirus particles are spherical, about 80 to  110 nanometers in diameter, and are\\nenveloped with a membrane. Each virus particle contains four types of proteins: two glycoproteins (78 and\\n58K) partially embedded in the membrane and forming two types of external projections ; a 29K protein\\nassociated with the three viral RNAs within the particle and forming three\\npseudocircular nucleoprotein structures; and a few molecules of a large (330K) protein that is thought to be\\nthe virus replicase.\\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions: Tospoviruses are transmitted by at least seven species of thrips.\\nThese include the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), tobacco thrips (F. fusca), common blossom\\nthrips (F. schultzei), onion thrips ( Thrips tabaci ), and melon thrips ( T. palmi). Tospoviruses can be acquired\\nfrom infected plants by thrips larvae but not by adult thrips. Once a larva acquires the virus, however, usually\\nafter feeding on an infected leaf for 30 minutes or more, it retains the virus through molting, pupation, and\\nemergence so that the emerging adult thrips is viruliferous and can transmit the virus to healthy plants for the\\nrest of its life. Inoculation feeding periods must be 30 minutes or longer. Fortunately, adult thrips, once alighting,\\ndo not move from plant to plant as much as aphids do and so transmission of tospoviruses is not as explosive\\nas some of the aphid-borne viruses.\\nTospoviruses overseas on in their perennial or biennial hosts from which their thrips vectors transmit them to\\nhealthy plants. The virus spreads into phloem and parenchyma cells and multiplies in their cytoplasm. Virus\\nparticles appear to form in densely staining patches of cytoplasm (viroplasms), possibly by budding, and release\\nfrom regions of two parallel membranes.

India, accounts for about 8.7 million MTs with an area of 0.53 million hectares under cultivation\\nof brinjal.  Brinjal is rich in fiber; people consume eggplant to facilitate proper bowel movement. Brinjal contains\\nplenty of carbohydrate and 100g serving of raw brinjal contains 2.5g of carbohydrate, 2.5g of fiber, and 75kj of\\nenergy. It is a rich source of minerals like potassium, copper, magnesium and manganese and vitamins (B6, C,\\nK, folate, niacin) and is low in saturated fats, cholesterol and sodium. People suffering from heart disease, high\\ncholesterol and hypertension can eat eggplant in liberal quantity. Purple skinned eggplants have phenols which\\nhelp our body to make use of the blood sugar. Phenols also help in inhibiting an enzyme causing high blood\\npressure in the body. A handful of bacterial and fungal diseases can strike your eggplant patch, causing blemished\\nfruits, marred foliage, decreased production and sometimes plant death. Damping off ( Pythium spp.,\\nPhytophthora spp., Rhizoctonia spp.), Phomopsis Blight (Phomopsis vexans), leaf spot (Cercospora melongenae),\\nAlternaria leaf spots (Altrenaria melongenae), fruit rot (Phytophthora nicotianae), Verticillium Wilt (Verticilium\\ndahliae) are major diseases of brinjal and cause significant losses in yield and quality of the produce.\\nDamping off\\nGeographical origin, distribution and crop losses: Damping off is a severe disease of solanaceous crops including\\neggplant in nursery. Several soil borne pathogens attack seed, seedling and transplant and thus cause disease\\nin plants. The disease is not only responsible for the poor seed germination and stand of seedlings, but also\\ncarry the pathogens into the main field and affect the crop. The diseased seedlings are one of the major\\nsources for rapid and efficient spread of disease in the field. Damping off disease spreads in nurseries and\\ntransplanted plants from initial infection points, causing large areas in which usually all the seedlings are\\nkilled. Many researchers reported severe losses caused by this disease.\\nSymptoms: Affected plants generally occur in scattered patches in nursery or in lower parts of the slope fields.\\nIn even slope fields, diseased plants are usuallyoccurringrandomly in the fields. Damping off may occur as pre\\nor post emergence. In pre-emergence damping off, target of the pathogen is seed and on infectionit fails to\\ngrow after sowing. On attack of the pathogen seeds soft, mushy and turnbrown, and later decompose because\\nof seed infection. In post-emergence damping-off, the seedgerminate from underneath the soil, but dies soon.\\nThe affected portions mainly root, hypocotyls and crown of the plant, become pale brown, soft, water soaked\\nand weaker than non-affected part. Infected stems collapse. Root rot and collar rot makes the plant stunted.\\nSeverity of the symptoms usually changes with the stage of the crop development. Pathogen takes time to\\nestablish in the host and thus infection by the pathogen(s) may occur much later after plant emerges; in this\\ncase, the infection is usually not severe, but the overall plant growth and yield production may be affected.'),\n",

Severe\\nroot rotting results in nutrient deficiencies symptoms in the plant since nutrients may not be sufficiently\\navailable from the soil up through the plant. Since number of pathogens are responsible for identical symptoms,\\nidentification of respective pathogen after isolation is needed to confirm diagnosis.\\nCausal organism and Key characteristics: Damping off diseases is caused by number of Pythium spp. such as\\nPythium aphanidermatum, P . butleri, P . inflatum, Phytophthora parasitica, Fusarium oxyspoprum, F. solani,\\nPhomopsis vexans, Colletotrichum capsici, Rhizoctonia solani  and Sclerotium rolfsii.  In Pythium, P.\\naphanidermatum  and P . buleri are common species and mycelium of P . aphanidermatum is white, well\\ndeveloped, and woolly but not as abundant or vigorous as of P . butleri and less profusely. The hyphae are 2.8\\nto 7.5 µm in diameter, sporangiophore produces lobed, toruloid, branched. Encysted zoospores are 6.7-12.0\\nµm in size. Spherical, smooth oogonia are formed terminal on later hyphae and antheridia form monoclinous,\\nintercalary or terminal. On each oogonia, 1-2 antheridia attach. Oospores are single aplerotic, moderately\\nthick walled (17-19 µm).\\nDisease Cycle and Epidemiology: Seedlings during the initial three weeks after sowing are susceptible under\\nthe following predisposing factors: When planted in heavily infested soil or medium growth, overwatering or\\npoor drainage, overcrowding of the seedling with poor ventilation, excessive doses of nitrogen, variable\\nenvironmental conditions such as rainy, cloudy weather tha t results in prolonged soil moisture, low sunlight\\nthat prevents drying. These pathogenic fungi cause disease in a wide range of plants. These pathogens belong\\nto similar genera of fungi with different environmental requirements for the disease development. For example,\\ncool and wet climate favours Pythium and Phytophthora. Within Pythium spp., P . ultimum proliferate well\\nunder the low temperatures, while P . aphanidermatum active in high temperatures. Overwintering spores of\\nthese fungi can survive well in soil for a long period in the non-availability of host plants. favourable temperature\\nfor pre-emergence damping off is 20-25°C, while post emergence damping off was more severe at 40°C. High\\nsoil moisture and soil temperature accelerate development of the disease. These fungi colonize on the various\\nplant debris. Clay soil favoured the most damping off disease’s incidence caused by P . aphanidermatum and\\nvery less in sandy soil. Irrigation system in green houses contributes to fast spread of the Pythium spp. They\\nform oospores and chlamydospores on decaying of plant roots which later survive for long period under\\nadverse conditions and leads to subsequent inf ection. The disease incidence is enhanced, if nematodes are\\nalready present in nursery soil, which helps to cause injury to the roots for entry of the pathogen.\\nDisease management\\nCultural practices: Soil solarization of irrigated soil for 30 days decreased pre and post occurrence of damping\\noff disease in brinjal. Nursery sowing in the same bed year after year with frequent heavy irrigation should be\\navoided. Healthy brinjal seedling should be raised in the nursery bed with the field soil added with sand and\\nfarm yard manure.\\nBiological control: Seed treatment with native biological consortium Pseudomonas and Azotobacter species\\nprovides an enhanced level of protection compared to the native individual antagonistic bacteria to control\\npre and post emergence damping of brinjal. Trichoderma harzianum and T. viride formulations applied as\\nseed treatment reduced damping off in brinjal and brinjal in the field and enhance the plant biomass under\\nfield conditions\\nSeed treatment with Murray koenghii (20% extract) showed better results in managing damping off. Inoculation\\nof mycorrhizal fungus Glomus fasciculatum either simultaneously or 2 weeks before the inoculation with P.\\naphanidermatum reduced damping off and increased plant height in comparison to control.

Microconidia (1.5 to 3.5 µm) are produced on short lateral branches of the\\nmycelium in chains. The pathogen produces sclerotia at the periphery of the colony, which initially are white\\nand later turn black in colour, round to irregular in shape. The sclerotia also germinate by producing stalked\\napothecia, which ranges one to five per sclerotium under suitable humidity and light conditions. Apothecia\\nare brown in colour and are round or lobate type. Asci are cylindrical measuring 108-153 x 4.5-10 µm in size.\\nEach ascus contains eight ascospores and is released in clouds. Ascospores are elliptical and varies from 7-16\\nx 3.6-10 µm in size.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Sclerotia germinate by forming apothecium which in turn forms asci\\nunder humidity and light condition. Sclerotia are also capable of infecting the plants. After infection, the fungus\\nproduces oxalic acid, which kills the cells in advance. A fluffy mycelium appears on the host surface and cool\\nand moist during scarcity of food for fungus weather the mycelium coagulates and starts forming sclerotia,\\nwhich are initially white in colour, but later turns black. The fungus survives in soil in the form of sclerotia over\\na wide range of temperatures i.e. from 0 to 25°C with an optimum at 15 to 20°C. High moisture and low\\ntemperature conditions are necessary for infection. The fungus can tolerate wide pH range but is best adapted\\nto an acidic substrate.\\nManagement\\n•  The following management practices may be followed against Sclerotinia  rot. Seed must be free from\\nsclerotia and seed infection. If sclerotia are observe d in the seed lot, these should be removed with\\nfloatation. Seed borne mycelium can be inactivated by seed treatment with fungicide like iprodione +\\nthiram. Seed treatment can also be carried out with the biocontrol agent like Trichoderma harzianum or\\nT. viride.\\nFig.24: Symptoms of Rhizoctonia root rot in brinjal Fig. 26: Symptoms of Sclerotinia blight on stem and\\nleaves of brinjal\\nBrinjal'),\n",

In India, the disease is known to\\noccur in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, Kerala, Karnataka,\\nTamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand. Up to 90.6 per cent loss in tomato yield due to\\nthis disease has been reported in some badly affected fields in India.\\nSymptoms: The characteristic symptoms of the disease are drooping\\nof lower leaves, wilting, stunting, and yellowing of the foliage followed\\nby full-plant wilting (\\nFig. 29 ) and brown discoloration of vascular\\nsystem. Milky white bacterial ooze is produced when cut ends of\\nwilted plant are placed in water. Development of adventitious roots\\nfrom the stem is considerably increased. Tendency of excessive\\nadventitious root formation depends on the number of vascular\\nbundles invaded. Adventitious roots develop just outside the invaded\\nvascular bundle. Presence of nematode in the soil predisposes the\\ninfection. Sudden drooping of leaves without yellowing and rotting\\nof the stem is observed if wet weather with high temperature prevails\\nfor considerable period. The bacteria multiply rapidly in the xylem\\nvessel and finally block the translocation of water which causes wilting\\nof the plant. All parenchyma cells near to the vessels with bacteria\\nbecome necrotic. The pit membranes are often thicker with high\\nelectron density.  After collapse of the plant the bacteria were found\\nto be released into the soil.\\nCausal organism: Ralstonia solanacearum\\nKey Characteristics:  The bacterium is gram negative, rod shaped,\\nfrequently occurs in pairs, motile with 1 to 4 polar flagella and\\nmeasures 0.5-0.7 x 1.5-2.5 µm (\\nFig. 10). It is aerobic and catalase and oxidase-positive and forms nitrites from\\nnitrates. It, like some other non-fluorescent pseudomonads, produces intracellular, refractile, sudanophilic\\ninclusions consisting of polyhydroxy-butyric acid. Some strains produce a brown diffusible pigment on complex\\nFig. 29: Symptoms of bacterial wilt of\\nbrinjal'),\n",

The pathogen is negative for levan production and\\nstarch hydrolysis. It causes weak hydrolysis.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Once inside the host, the bacterium has an affinity for the vascular\\nsystem where it multiplies rapidly filling the xylem vessels with bacterial cells and slime. Wilt occurs within 2-\\n5 days after infection depending upon host susceptibility, temperature and virulence of the pathogen. As the\\nhost wilts, the pathogen invades parenchyma cells in the pith and cortex and pockets filled with masses of\\nbacteria develop around the vascular bundles. Under favorable conditions the bacterium may move through\\nthe cortex and exudes on the surface of the stem. It is released in to the soil from the roots of the infected\\nplants and from decaying host material. Optimum temperature for the growth of the bacterium is 35-37°C.\\nDisease does not develop at 15°C and most favorable temperature for rapid development of the disease takes\\nplace at 37°C. The disease mostly develops, when mean temperature is above 20°C.\\nAccumulation of oxidized phenolics and plant cell break down products are responsible for internal browning\\nof the vascular tissues. Brown discoloration of the vascular bundles can be observed by splitting the stem and\\nroots longitudinally.\\nManagement:\\nThe following management practices may be followed.\\nSelection of disease-free field: The selected field should have no previous history of bacterial wilt disease.\\nThe field in which susceptible solanaceous host had grown during the previous year should not be selected.\\nDisease incidence can be successfully reduced with regular rotation with other non-host plants. However,\\nshort duration rotation (one year) with paddy doesn’t make the field disease free.\\nUse of pathogen free seedlings: Nursery for raising brinjal seedling should not be in the fields with the history\\nof bacterial wilt.  Fumigation or soil solarization of soil 15 days prior to sowing is recommended.\\nPrevent the spread of the pathogen: Immediate removal of infected plants is strictly recommended.  The\\ninfected portion of the field should be isolated immediately by  preventing the water flow into and from the\\nfield. Frequency of irrigation should be reduced. Flood irrigation in the infected field should be avoided as it\\nincreases the disease incidence  by two-fold. Movement of people/machinery should also be restricted.\\nReduction of the pathogen load: The following methods are effective in reducing the pathogen load in the\\ninfected field. (a) Crop rotation for 3-4 years with paddy and other non-host crops (b) Flooding the field for 1-\\n3 weeks before planting (c) the incidence of nematode can be reduced by growing marigold (Tagetes spp.) in\\nrotation or as intercrop (d) enhance the activity of beneficial microflora by application of organic manures like\\nFYM/ vermicompost every year.\\nBiological control:\\na) Nursery application: Seed treatment with talc ba sed consortial formulation of antagonistic biocontrol\\nagent viz. Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma harzianum (10 g/100 g of seeds).\\n b) Root dip treatment: Mixing of 1 kg of the consortial bioformulation with 1 L of starch solution (rice gruel)\\nand keep the root of the seedling for an hour before transplanting. One kg of the formulation is enough\\nfor root dip treatment of 1000 numbers of seedlings.\\nc) Soil application: one kg of the consortia of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma harzianum are\\nmixed with 10 kg of dry cow dung or vermicompost and apply @ 100 g per plant.\\nBrinjal'),\n",

Phytoplasma bodies (230-770 nm) are found\\nassociated with the phloem cells of roots of the eggplant affected with little leaf. Many alternate hosts and\\nnatural leafhopper vectors are known as natural reservoirs for these phytoplasma strains associated with\\nbrinjal phyllody and little leaf in India (Rao 2021).

The vector Hishimonus phycitis transmits the disease from\\nweed hosts to healthy plants. Early sown crops (June sown) escape the disease compared to July and August\\nsown crops due to differences in vector populations. Continuous cropping of the susceptible varieties increased\\ndisease incidence, as did the presence of weeds, sweet potato or tomato crops in the vicinity, which helps to\\nincrease in vector populations.\\nManagement\\n•     Periodical spray of systemic insecticides such as Thiamethoxam 25 WG @150 g/ha or imidacloprid 17.8 SL\\n@150 ml per hectare is necessary to control leaf hopper vector.\\n•\\n       Uproot the severely infected plants and burn just before starting of spray schedule.\\n•      Treatment of seedlings with (Streptomycin Sulphate + Tetracyclin hydrochloride @ 150 ppm) for 20-30\\nminutes + installation of yellow sticky traps @ 15 /ha after 20 days of transplanting + destruction of the\\ninfected plants + need based foliar application of Streptomycin Sulphate + Tetracyclin hydrochloride @\\n150 ppm and the insecticide Imidacloprid @ 0.3 ml per liter.\\n•      Temporary remission of symptoms by tetracycline (Anjaneyulu and Ramakrishnan, 1973; Raychaudhuri\\net al., 1970).\\n•    Severity of the phytoplasma disease could be reduced by roughing symptomatic plants and spraying\\ninsecticides\\n•  Selection and screening of brinjal resistant genotypes resistant to phytoplasma infection\\n•   Wild relatives of brinjal (Solanum integrifolium and S. gilo) were resistant to the little leaf disease\\n•      Eradication of weeds that harbor phytoplasma and its insect vector, along with spraying insecticides may\\nbe significant in minimizing the eggplant phytoplasma disease incidence in the fields.\\nReferences:\\nRao GP (2021) Our understanding about phytoplasma research scenario in India.

There are five domesticated species of\\nchilli peppers and Capsicum annuum  includes many common varieties such as bell peppers, \\nwax, cayenne, jalapeños. Capsaicin and related compounds known as capsaicinoids are the substances\\ngiving chille peppers their intensity when ingested or applied topically. Other varieties of capsicum\\ninclude bell peppers (sweet peppers), but while chilli peppers  are pungent, bell peppers are not. Chilli is a\\nvery remunerative, widely grown indispensable spice as well as cash crop to the world food industry and\\nis cultivated in almost all states of the country. Chilli pepper pods are, technically, berries. When used\\nfresh, they are most often prepared and eaten like a vegetable. Whole pods can be dried and then crushed\\nor ground into chilli powder that is used as a spice or seasoning. Chillies can be dried to prolong their shelf\\nlife. Chilli peppers can also be preserved by brining, immersing the pods in oil, or by pickling. India is the\\nmajor and highly erratic producer, consumer and exporter of chilli. About 80% of Indian chilli is consumed\\ndomestically and the remaining is exported to other countries. However, Indian chilli consignments for\\nexport face twin challenges of pesticide residues and aflatoxin contamination. Chilli crops suffer with\\nvarious  fungal diseases such as damping off ( Pythium sp.), Anthracnose/Fruit rot/Die back (Colletotrichum\\ncapsici and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides), Fusarial wilt (Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum), Rhizoctonia\\nroot rot (Rhizoctonia botaticola), Cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora capsici.) and Alternaria leaf spot (Alternaria\\nsolani),  bacterial diseases like bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacerum) and leaf spot (Xanthomonas sp.) and\\nviral diseases such as  such as mosaic, tospo, iIlar and leaf curl. In addition, Aflatoxin contamination\\n(Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus) and fruit rots caused by Colletotrichum sp., Alternaria sp., Fusarium\\nsp. and Rhizopus have been reported as post harvest diseases on chilli.\\nName of disease: DAMPING OFF\\nGeographical origin, distribution and crop losses:  Damping off of Chilli cause 62% seedling mortality and\\n90 per cent of plant death both at pre or post-emer gence stage in the nursery, fields and greenhouse. It can\\ncause serious loss under field and greenhouse condition affecting newly emerging seedlings and infecting the\\nhosts by rapidly infesting germinating seeds, ther efore creating obstruction in management. This disease is\\nconsidered as an important limiting factor in successful cultivation of crop plants throughout the world.\\nSymptoms: Damping-off of seedlings occurs in two stages i.e., pre- and post-emergence stage. Post -emergence\\ndamping off is more conspicuous than pre-emergence phase, which often go undetected except resulting into\\npoor crop stand. In pre-emergence phase, young seedlings disintegrate, get killed before reaching soil surface.\\nThe radicle and plumule rot before hypocotyl break seed coat, leading to poor field emergence or seed\\nChilli\\n3'),\n",

In post-emergence phase, disease develop after seedlings have emerged out of soil, causing\\ninfection in stems before lignification. The disease is characterized by lesion formation at collar region,\\nappearance of brown water-soaked areas and softening of tissues. Infected stems become hard, constricted\\nat base, thin i.e., wire stem symptoms, shrivel and collapse, ultimately topple over giving patchy appearances\\nboth in nursery and main fields. In nursery and field conditions, damping-off infection usually radiates from\\ninitial infection points causing large spots or areas killing large number of seedlings. Generally, cotyledons and\\nleaves wilt before seedlings are prostrated, but in some cases, seedlings remain green and turgid until they\\ncollapse.\\nCausal organism:  Pythium aphanidermatum  (Edson) Fitz. Several soil inhabiting fungi predominantly\\nPythium spp. viz., P . aphanidermatum, P . debaryanum, P . ultimum cause seed rot and damping off of chilli\\nseedings.\\nKey characteristics:  The pathogens associated with this disease are either seed or soil borne or both.\\nSpecies of Pythium, Phytophthora, Fusarium, Sclerotium attack the plants when they are in juvenile stage.\\nIn chilli crop two species of Pythium have been reported. i.e Pythium ultimum Trow. Fitz. and Pythium\\naphanidermatum (Edson) are reported to cause damping off. Among them P . aphanidermatum is more in\\nhabitats like hydroponic culture and low-lying areas, while P . ultimum generally occurs relatively in dry\\nareas.  They infect many hosts unlike Phytophthora which is host specific.  Soil moisture near saturation\\nstimulates mycelial growth as well as asexual reproduction. Propagules capable of causing infection include\\nvegetative mycelium, germinating sporangia, zoospores and oospores. Some propagules, particularly\\nzoospores may meetchilli plants by chemotaxis. Infective propagules are capable of direct penetration,\\nbut wounds enhance penetration and infection.\\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions: Damping off of chili is soil borne in nature and practice of\\nmonoculture together make the crop susceptible to disease. The cultivars grown are not resistant to the\\npathogen which also helps to spread the disease. The disease becomes severe at high temperature and\\nhumidity.

The pathogen attacks nearly all kinds of succulent plants including flowers, shrubs,\\nweeds and vegetables including chilli.\\nSymptoms:  The disease is observed in December to January during low temperature, cloudy weather and\\nhigh atmospheric humidity accompanied by soil moisture.  The disease cause infection at all stages of the\\nsusceptible crops viz. French bean, chilli, potato, brinjal etc. The primary symptom of the disease is the\\npresence of wilted plants in a field of healthy-\\nlooking plants. Infection occurs mainly on\\nstems and branches. As a result of infection,\\nunder severe conditions, the portion of plant\\nbeyond the infection wilts. Soft, wet, water-\\nsoaked rotting is observed on stem followed\\nby white fungal growth over it.  Infected stem\\nturns white after drying (\\nFig. 34 & 35 ). This\\nmycelium develops honeydew stage soon after\\ncolonization. The pith region is filled with\\nbrown to black coloured sclerotia. In case of\\ninfection in the fruits, rotting of flesh occurs\\nwith numerous sclerotia.\\nCausal organism: White rot of chilli is caused by soil-borne fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.\\nKey characteristics: The pathogen is capable of reproducing both sexually and asexually. The sclerotia are\\nof two to three thick layers of hyphal aggregates, ring, medulla and cortex. The outer ring is composed of\\nmelanin incorporating the black colour.\\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions: The ascospores of S. sclerotiorum  only infect the flower of\\nsusceptible hosts and begin to invade the host’s tissues via mycelium, causing infection. S. sclerotiorum\\ncan invade nearly all tissue types including stems, foliage, flowers, fruits, and roots. Upon infection white,\\nfluffy mycelium will grow on the surface of the infected tissues. S. sclerotiorum  once again will produce\\nsclerotia at the end of the growing season. The sclerotia will then remain on the surface of soil, until the\\nnext season.

Its fruits are good source of vitamins A, B, C and protein,\\ncarbohydrate, fats, minerals iron and iodine. Okra seeds contain 26% protein and 18.1 % oil. The mature pods\\nand stems of okra containing crude fibers are used for clearing sugarcane juice for making jaggery (gur) and in\\npaper industry. Okra has a good potential as a fo reign exchanger crop in India and accounts for 60% of the\\nexport of fresh vegetables. India ranks first in the world with 5,784.0 thousand tonnes (72% of the total world\\nproduction) of ladyfinger/okra. In India, okra is grown on 376.1 thousand hac. Producing 3684.0 thousand\\ntones with an average yield of 9.8 tones per hectares. West Bengal is the leading okra producing state which\\nhas production of around 718.9 thousand tons followed by Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

The haustoria lie outside the cytoplasm of\\nthe host and special structures are formed between the haustoria and\\nthe cytoplasm. These interfacial structures distinguish haustoria from\\nhyphae and therefore, their structures and physiology are important\\nfactors in parasitism. The conidiophores arise vertically from the\\nsuperficial hyphae on the host surface. Each conidiophore bears conidia\\neither singly or in chains. Of these, only the last one in the chain\\nmatures as the spores are formed in regular order from the tip\\ndownwards. The mature conidia fall-off quickly and are disseminated by wind.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions:  The fungus is an obligate parasite and perennates either through\\ncleistothecia. The primary infection of the lower leaves is caused by windblown ascospores (where ever\\ncleistothecia are present) or by conidia formed on the crop sown earlier in the neighbouring areas. The conidia\\nformed abundantly on primary infections are blown by wind and air currents and cause secondary infections.\\nThe powdery mildew of pea becomes a serious problem under warm and dry conditions during the day and\\ncool nights. Irrigation at flowering to pod formation stages can prolong the vegetative phase, thereby increasing\\nperiod for susceptibility. The disease is more prevalent in dry weather and moderate temperatures.

Very soon white fungus growth is observed\\non the rotted portion.  Later, embedded sclerotia in white mycelium formed on the infected portion as well as\\ninner portion of pith and fruits.  Primary infection on pea and cowpea always starts from floral infection\\nfollowed by pods. Seeds converted into sclerotia and become concomitant mixture during threshing.\\nCausal organism: The disease is caused by a ubiquitous fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.\\nKey characteristics:  The mycelium of the fungus is hyaline, septate and branched. Hyphae are inter and\\nintracellular and invade all the tissues of the affected host portion. The mycelium forms sclerotia, which are\\ngenerally irregular and elongate and vary in size with age and environmental conditions. Apothecia emerge\\nthrough pores in rind of the sclerotia when moisture is abundant. Apothecia are tan, fleshy, funnel-shaped\\ncups on thin stalks. Ascospores (5.9-7.3 x 11.7-15.1 µm) are discharged from the apothecia in great abundance\\nto a height of 1-15 cm.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: The pathogen perpetuates in the form of sclerotia left in soil or plant\\ndebris. The sclerotia germinate either carpogenically or myceliogenically. Sclerotia on or just below the soil\\nsurface can germinate myceliogenically and form mycelium, which invade plant issues directly at the contact\\npoints. During the extended periods of cloud and high moisture, ascospores discharged from apothecia are\\nthe more common source of infection. Ascospores either directly infect the host or they fall on fallen flowers\\n(petals) and grow in them to produce mycelium. This mycelim can also cause infection and help in secondary\\nspread of the disease. After infection, the fungus produces oxalic acid, which kills the cells in advance.\\nThe fungus responsible for this disease is soil borne in the form of sclerotia, which can infect the susceptible\\nhost over a wide range of temperatures i.e. from 0 to 28°C with an optimum at 20 to 25°C. The fungus can\\ntolerate wide pH range but is best adapted to an acidic substrate. Ascospores start germinating within 4 h at a\\ntemperature range of 5-25°C (optimum 20°C). At  15-20°C, number and dry weight of sclerotia is maximum.\\nProlonged spells of rain during February-March play an important role in the primary infection and spread of\\nthe disease and the incidence was positively correlated with the percentage of rainy days and total rainfall.\\nManagement\\n• All infected part must be carefully collected and burnt before drying of the plants.\\n•  Seed cleaning is essential to remove the sclerotial mixture during threshing and processing.\\n• Deep ploughing, low land paddy with continuous stagnation of water reduces the sclerotial population.\\n•  Close planting and dense canopy of plant should be avoided.\\n• Remove all the weeds particularly dicots from the field.\\n• Fungicidal spray must be started at early bloom stage or flowering stage.

It remains available for about 8-10 months in\\nthe year. Cucurbits belong to the family Cucurbitaceae having a large family of plants with 130 genera and 800\\nspecies known all around the world and among them and out of that it contains at least 9 genera and of them\\n16 species are cultivated such as sponge gourd, ridge gourd, muskmelon, watermelon, round melon, pumpkin,\\nvegetable marrow cucumber, snake gourd, pointed gourd, kheera, bottle gourd etc. They have nutritional and\\nmedicinal value.  Cucurbitaceae members have been characterized with insecticidal/ wormicidal control, anti-\\nhypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-lipidemic characteristics. Fruits of bottle gourd and bitter gourd are\\nused for control of diabetes. Cucurbits are warm wea ther crops which are sown, grown and harvested over\\nspring, summer and autumn. The cucurbit crops suffer from several fungal, bacterial, viral, nematodes and\\nnutrients deficiency diseases. Among them, fungal diseases [powdery mildew ( Podosphaera\\nxanthii and Erysiphe cichoracearum), downy mildew ( Pseudoperonospora cubensis) , anthracnose fruit rot\\n(Colletotrichum obiculare), damping off and fusarial wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. niveum)], bacterial diseases\\n[bacterial wilt (Erwinia tracheiphila), bacterial fruit rot (Pectobacterium sp.) and angular leaf spot (Pseudomonas\\nsyringae pv. lachrymans)], viral diseases (cucumber mosaic virus and pumpkin mosaic virus) and nematodes\\ndiseases (root knot of cucurbits and Reniform nematode) are major diseases to reduce the production and\\nquality of the produce of cucurbits.\\nName of disease: DAMPING OFF, SEEDLING AND ROOT ROTS OF CUCURBITS\\nGeographical origin, distribution, and crop losses: Damping off and root rot of cucurbits has been reported\\nfrom nursery beds and young seedlings of cucumber, melon, watermelon, pumpkin, summer squash, and\\nwinter squash throughout the cucurbit growing areas\\n. In green houses, cucumber damping off disease is\\nwidespread. These diseases have increased rapidly under protected cultivation.\\nSymptoms: Water-soaked lesions\\noccurring at soil level are the first\\nvisible symptoms of damping off in\\ncucurbitaceous family.  The disease\\nspreads and ultimately the seedling\\nwilts and decays.

Often, plants that have survived damping-off\\nmay show symptoms of root rot. Root rot affected roots shows a watery grey appearance. Cottony leak,\\nsometimes called Pythium fruit rot or Pythium cottony leak, is a common disease of cucurbits which appears\\nin the form of white cottony growth of the pathogen on the fruit (\\nFig. 52).\\nCausal organism and Key characteristics: Cucurbit damping-off and seedling root rots have been reported to\\nbe caused by various species of Pythium like P . aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp., P . irregulare Buisman, P . ultimum\\nTrow. and P . spinosum Swada. Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn, P . capsici Leon. and Phytophthora drechsleri Tucker\\noccur independently and in combination with the species of the Pythium, Fusarium spp. including F. oxysporum\\nf. sp. cucumerinum Owen frequently causes rotting of seeds and damping-off.\\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions: Damping-off of cucurbits is usually most severe in conditions having\\nhigh soil moisture, high plant population, lack of aeration, cool, dampand, cloudy weather. In addition, root\\nrot is also favoured by deep planting. Severe incidence of P . aphanidermatum was found in watermelons and\\nmuskmelon which were sown in cool, moist soil which appears to form crusts around or over the hypocotyls.\\nSoon after one week of sowing or transplanting seedlings get more prone to damping off. Unsterilized soil in\\ngreen houses is more susceptible to damping off fungi and heavy irrigation also exacerbates damping-off.\\nPythium fruit rot is favored due to moist soil at growing time.\\nDisease management\\nCultural practices:\\nSoil solarization and soil enrichment with organic matter or oil cakes and or biofumigation have a great potential\\nto prevent incidence of damping off. Biofumigation with cabbage residue incorporated at the top 20 cm of soil\\nat the rate of 5 kg m\\n- and solarization enhanced crop growth. Effects on pathogen inoculum levels, disease\\nseverity and plant growth parameters were greater during summer seasons than in winter. Simple cultural\\npractices like sanitation measures, irrigation schedule, raised beds and good quality seeds help to keep the\\ndisease away.\\nChemical control:\\nSeed treatment with captan or thiram @ 2.5 to 3 g/kg seed is found effective to control incidence of damping\\noff disease. Drenching with the mixture of mancozeb (0.25%) and carbendazim (0.1%) to the plants after\\nseedling emergence controls the disease significantly.\\nBiological control:\\nApplication of biocontrol agents through seed treatment and soil application in the nursery bed before sowing\\nis a good option to control the disease. Actinomycetes ( Streptomyces) isolates inhibited the growth of the P.\\naphanidermatum in culture as well as under greenhouse conditions against damping off disease in melon.\\nCucumber seeds treated with spores of Serratia marcescens N4--5 and ethanol extracts of the bacterial cultures\\nprovide significant suppression of damping-off disease caused by P . ultimum. Besides cucumber, the spores of\\nthis bacterium also suppress damping-off caused by P . ultimumon cantaloupe, musk melon, and pumpkin.\\nSelective antagonistic bacterium Bacillus pumilus strain SQR-N43 can manage damping off disease of cucumber\\ncaused by R. solani. The application of bioagent stabilizes the population and increases the active form of the\\nantagonist. The treated cucumber seeds with ethanol extract of Serratia marcesens N4-5 controls damping off\\ncaused by P . ultimum. They also reported that N4-5 extract was found compatible with two Trichoderma\\nCucurbits'),\n",

However, in Punjab, when winter temperatures are too low for the growth of cucurbits, the fungus\\nperpetuates in the form of active mycelium on self-sown or cultivated sponge gourd growing in sheltered\\nplaces during severe winters and also in open during milder winters.  The pathogen can survive as both mycelia\\nand sporangia on a wide range of wild host. It is transmitte d by insects and other invertebrates. In saturated\\natmosphere, maximum sporulation occurs at 18-28°C. The day temperature of 25-30°C, night temperature of\\n15-21°C and RH> 75% favours the disease development, 20°C is optimum temperature for germination and\\ninfection.\\nManagement\\n• Crop should be grown with wide spacing in well-drained soil.\\n• Air movement and sunlight exposure helps in checking the disease initiation and development.\\n• Bower system of cropping reduces the disease incidence.\\n• Field sanitation by burning crop debris to reduce the inoculum.\\n• Seed production should be preferably carried out in summer season because summer crop is often free\\nfrom disease.\\n• Alternate foliar spray of azoxystrobin 23% SC @0.1%, zineb75%WP @0.2% and azoxystrobin 4.8% w/w +\\nchlorothalonil 40% w/w @0.3%, metiram 55% + pyraclostrobin 5% WG, cymoxanil 8% + mancozeb 64%\\nWP @ 1500 g per hectare\\nReferences:\\nBhardwaj DR, Gautam KK, Saha S, Nagendran K, Pandey KK, Singh AK, Singh B (2018) Mining the source of\\nresistance for downy mildew and gummy stem blight in bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) accessions.

Plant may wither and die.  Growth of plant and fruits seized.  Transpiration rate is very fast from infected\\nleaves.\\nCausal organism:  Two pathogens are associated with this disease i.e. Sphaerotheca fuligena  and Erysiphe\\ncichoracearum. In addition to these two fungi, Leveillula taurica has also been found to be associated with\\npowdery mildew symptoms.\\nKey characteristics: Perithecia of all three pathogens have indeterminate mycelial appendages. Conidia of E.\\ncichoracearum singe celled, hyaline, barrel shaped, in chains. Perithecia contain a single ascus. The ascospores are\\nsingle celled, hyaline, spherical, 6-10 per ascus.

It is transmitted by insect vectors, primarily the striped\\ncucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum (Fabricius)) and the spotted cucumber\\nbeetle ( Diabrotica undecimpunctata  howardi Barber). The western spotted\\ncucumber beetle ( D. undecimpunctata undecimpunctata Mannerheim), the\\nbanded cucumber beetle (D. balteata LeConte), and other insects that cause\\nwounds, such as grasshoppers, may also transmit the bacteria.\\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions: Not much is clear about the\\noverwintering of the bacterium causing wilt. Earlier, it was thought to\\noverwinter in the intestine tract of adult cucumber beetles on fence bushes or nearby tress. It has been observed\\nthat the bacterium remains viable in dried plant debris for very short time. Seed or soil does not transmit it. In\\nthe stems of host plant, the bacterium dies as the stem dries up and is disintegrated. E. tracheiphila remains\\nviable in dried plant debris for very short periods of time. In plant stems, the pathogen dies as the stems\\ndeteriorate. It is not seed-transmitted, and there is no evidence that it survives in soil. Spread of bacteria to\\nhealthy shoots takes place through the dissolved walls of adjacent xylem vessels. Subsequent infections result\\nfrom infected plants serving as inoculum sources.\\nManagement\\n• Control of cucumber beetles at initial stage from the soil with neem cake or insecticides.\\n• Resistant varieties of cucumber should be grown.\\n• Summer ploughing of soil to expose all the stages of beetles.\\nName of disease: MOSAIC AND LEAF DISTORTION\\nGeographical origin, distribution and crop losses: The virus has wide occurrence throughout the world and is\\nknown to infect about 800 plant species. Doolittle (1916) and Jagger (1916) described this disease for the first\\ntime. Since than it has been reported from various countries of the world, but it is more prevalent in temperate\\nregions of the world. In India also, this disease has been reported. The infection of cucumber plants at\\ncotyledonary stage reduced the yield by 89 per cent in summer and 96 per cent in winter.\\nSymptoms: Most of the cucurbits grown in rainy season are affected by virus diseases like cucumber mosaic,\\ngreen mottle, leaf distortion, water mosaic etc.  Gener ally alternate green and yellow patches with mottling\\nsymptoms are observed (Fig 60a). Sometime leaf deformed and curled downward.  Smalling and narrowing of\\nthe leaves are also observed in leaf distortion virus ( Fig 60b).  Plants become small and excessive branching,\\nproliferation of the leaves, twigs, petioles, bushy appearance of the plants are observed (Fig 60c).\\nCausal organism: The disease is caused by Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is a member of cucumovirus group\\nand several strains, pathotypes and serotypes of this virus are known most of which can induce severe symptoms\\nin cucurbits (Francki et al., 1979).

Several volatile sulfur compounds are responsible for\\nthe characteristic flavor of the cole crops\\n. These crops are infected by several diseases, leading to reduced to\\nquantity and quality of the produce. Damping-off ( Pythium  species), downy mildew ( Hyloperonospora\\nbrassicae), Alternaria blight (Alternaria brassicicola and A. brassicae), Sclerotinia rot (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum),\\nclub rot (Plasmodiophora brassicae) and black rot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris), individually or in\\ncombinations have inflicted heavy damage to see d industry and commercial vegetable production.

This fungus produces brown hyphae that are up to 12 µm in diameter,\\nhas dolipore septa, with right angle branching and a crosswall in the adjacent branch. Since this fungus does\\nnot produce asexual spores, the perfect stage develops white, thin, hymenial layer near the collar region\\nwhich comprises basidia and hyaline basidiospores that measure 6-14 x 4-8 µm. This disease is highly favored\\nby the temperature in the range of 20 to 25°C and relative humidity from and 95 to 100%. The fungus is\\npolyphagous in nature and has been recorded on several hosts from various parts of the world. It attacks 287\\ngenera belonging to dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous families of Angiosperms and three each of\\nGymnosperms and Pteridophytes.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: The soil borne nature of Pythium spp. allows the pathogen to survive\\nin soil or plant debris for prolonged periods. The seedlings get affected before emergence lead to poor\\ngermination. Post emergence the seedlings topple down or die are said to “damp-off.” The severity of the\\ndisease depends on the amount of pathogen in the soil and environmental conditions. Cool, cloudy weather,\\nhigh humidity, wet soils, compacted soil, and overcrowding especially favor development of damping-off.\\nFields with unequal levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, soil pH ranging between 7.4 and 8.5 having\\nsandy-silt loam texture predispose the plants to the attack by pathogen. Application of ammoniacal form of\\nnitrogen decreases the disease incidence as compared to nitrate form. The seedling stage upto 20 days is\\nmore prone to attack of R. solania compared to 35 days and 50 days old plants. Sandy soil favors maximum\\nwire stem incidence while clay soil the least. The fungus hibernates and perpetuates in the soil and when\\nseedlings topple down and perish. The primary source of inoculum of R. solani is in the form of mycelium or\\nsclerotia favoured by high humidity and temperature. The sclerotia are resistant to drought and cope large\\nfluctuations in temperature. It is present in most soils and once established, remains there indefinitely. It\\nspreads through rain, irrigation water, agricultural tools etc.\\nDisease management\\nCultural practices:\\nUse of healthy seed, change of nursery site every year, disinfection of the plant bed either with soil solarization\\nor by fumigants like formaldehyde, deep ploughing during summer months, shallow seeding to encourage\\nrapid emergence and selection of the healthy seedlings at the time of transplanting should be followed to\\nkeep the disease under check. The disease reduced   appreciably by treating   the nursery soil with powders of\\ncommercial cellulose, rice stubbles or water hyacinth biomass in combination with NH\\n4NO3 is very effective.\\nTotal microbial population also increased in amended soil. It is observed that when C: N ratio increase in soil,\\nbacterial and actinomycetes increase and the contrary fungal population decreases.\\nCole crops'),\n",

It also causes extensive damage to the foliage at post transplanting stage\\nin cabbage and cauliflower. It is a serious threat to the well-established cauliflower seed industry (Mahajan et\\nal., 1995). Downy mildew has worldwide distribution. It was first recorded in 1883 at USA on Brassica spp.\\n(Farlow, 1883) and subsequently from other parts of the world (Channon, 1981). In India, this disease was first\\nreported by Butler (1918). The loss is enormous when it occurs in nursery, where it kills large numbers of\\nplants and retard growth of others. The disease is serious during both rainy and winter seasons and about 75-\\n90% seedling mortality has been recorded in Pune, Maharashtra (Gaikwad et al., 2004).\\nSymptoms: Important cole corps grown in India is cauliflower and cabbage.\\nDowny mildew is serious and may appear from nursery to curd formation stage.\\nSymptoms are observed on the leaves.  Fine hair like downy growth of fungus\\nis observed on the lower surface of leaves (\\nFig. 65 ).  Corresponding to the\\nfungal growth there is minute pinhead brown necrotic spots visible on the upper\\nsurface of leaves, which later coalesce to each other.\\nCausal organism: Downy mildew is caused by Peronospora parasitica.\\nKey characteristics:  It is an obligate pathogen and forms mycelium and haustoria inside host tissues.\\nSporangiophores emerge through the stomata and are dichotomously branched and terminate with slender\\ntips. Asexual spores are ephemeral and therefore rapid dispersal and infection is essential.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: The fungus survives between crop season as oospores or on cruciferous\\ncrop and weed plants. It also survives as sporangia on leaves and inflorescence and as latent systemic mycelium\\nin seeds or infected plant debris (Saharan et al., 1997). Infection is favoured by low temperatures and high\\natmospheric humidity following rain or dew. The penetration is usually direct but occasionally occurs through\\nFig. 65.

In India, it is noticed in areas where moderate temperature\\nand humidity prevails during crop season. A brassicae is encountered more\\nfrequently than A. brassicicola  in different cauliflower cultivars in Haryana\\nand Sikkim. A. brassicae and A. alternata were reported on cauliflower from\\nHooghly district of West Bengal. Alternaria affects cauliflower at all stages of\\ngrowth causing 80 per cent reduction in seed yield and rotting of curds making\\nthe produce commercially unmarketable.\\nSymptoms: Alternaria leaf spot is usually appeared in early stage of plant\\ngrowth in cauliflower while in later stage in cabbage. Alternaria leaf spots are\\nrestricted to lower leaves only and do not cause economic loss to the crop\\nexcept when some of the hybrid varieties of cauliflower are used.  Symptoms\\nappear as circular light brown spots on leaves. Concentric rings are clearly\\nvisible on the spots.  Black sporulation is observed in humid weather. Cabbage infections do not extend very\\nfar in the host tissue. Inflorescence and siliqua are severely infected during seed crop (\\nFig. 66). The curd of\\ncauliflower infected as brown discoloration of individual florets and flower clusters.\\nCausal organism: The disease is caused by Alternaria brassicae and A. brassisicola.\\nKey characteristics: Alternaria spp. are readily distinguished by spore size and morphology. A. brassicae conidia\\nare obclavate with one slender, unbranched beak that measures 55-75µm long; beaks extend from the apical\\nend of the spore body. Conidia have six to 19 transverse septa and one to eight longitudinal or oblique septa\\nand are borne in short chains of up to four spores. Both Alternaria species require free water for infection.\\nSporulation of these pathogens is favored by alternating light and dark periods. Spores are dispersed by splashing\\nwater and by wind. A. brassicicola germinated readily and required lesser incubation periods.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Alternaria spp. perennates as spores or mycelium on infected plant\\nresidues or on infected seeds and cruciferous weeds. When seed borne, pathogen may directly attack seedlings\\nand cause damping off, stem lesions or collar rot. Most often fungus sporulates on plant residues during\\nperiods of rain, heavy dew, or conditions of high soil moisture and dispersed locally by rain splashes and wind\\ncurrents. The pathogen is known to sporulate abundantly in decaying vegetable material in the soil. These two\\nFig. 66. Symptoms of Alternaria\\nblight on siliqua\\nCole crops'),\n",

Symptoms appear as water-soaked\\nrotting of curd, petiole, stalk and stump region of the leaves. Soon after infection,\\ngrowth of white mycelium is observed all over the infected portion.  Cauliflower\\ngrown for seed production is severely affected by the disease and entire inflorescence\\ncollapsed (\\nFig. 67). This mycelium develops honeydew stage after colonization of\\nthe tissue. Later, entire rotted portion is converted into compact mycelial mat\\nfollowed by hard black sclerotial body. This is the resting structure and primary\\ninoculum source.\\nCausal organism: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum\\nKey characteristics: Ascospores of Sclerotinia spp. infect upper portions of plants to cause diseases such as\\nflower blights, stem rots, fruit rots, and head blight. Initial water-soaked spots expand irregularly and\\nindeterminately, and girdle affected stem, which causes distal portions of the plant to wilt and then become\\nnecrotic. Affected tissues may develop a soft watery and a thick white mycelium forms, often both inside and\\noutside the tissue. As the disease progresses, desiccated plant tissues appear bleached compared to those\\nsenescing normally, and frequently, diseased tissue develops a shredded appearance.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Soilborne sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum most frequently, occurs after a\\nsignificant rain or irrigation event, and is aided by a shade d, slow-drying soil surface. Ascospores are forcibly\\ndischarged and extended periods of leaf wetness (16 to 48 hours) with temperatures in the range of 12 to 24°C\\npromote ascospore germination and infection. Colonized ‘weak’ tissues then serve as a food base to grow and\\nwith adequate wetness, mycelium moves from the colonized tissue into the vigorous host tissues of stems,\\nleaves, pods, etc. Later in the disease process, sclerotia form, either on the plant surface or within stems and\\nother plant parts. As the plant or plant part dies, the sclerotia fall to the soil where they can survive for\\nmultiple years.\\nManagement\\n•   Main crop of cauliflower and cabbage should be periodically observed near the stump region in cool,\\ncloudy and moist weather for primary infection.\\n•\\n    Cut the infected curds, leaves along with some healthy portion in morning and carefully collect in polythene\\nto avoid falling of sclerotia in the field.

Leading onion-producing countries are China, India, United States, Turkey\\nand Pakistan. India ranks second in area and production. Among the States, the area and production of onion\\nis the highest in Maharashtra accounting 28 percent of the country’s production followed by Gujarat, Orissa\\nand Uttar Pradesh.  Garlic ( Allium sativum L.) belong to Alliaceae family, has been widely recognized as a\\nvaluable vegetable, spice and a popular remedy for various ailments. The principal medicinal uses of garlic is\\nto prevent and treat cardiovascular disease by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, as an antimicrobial,\\nand as a preventive agent for cancer. The active constituents are several complex sulfur-containing compounds\\nthat are rapidly absorbed, transformed and metabolized. It is the second most widely cultivated Allium spp.\\nGarlic has played an important dietary, as well as medicinal, role for centuries. Even today the medicinal value\\nof garlic is widespread and fast growing. Among 140 growing countries, China ranks number one in production\\nfollowed by India. The low productivity of garlic in India can be mainly attributed to the non-availability of\\nvirus-free planting material, which is of utmost importance in a vegetative propagated crop like garlic.\\nOnion and garlic are susceptible to numerous foliar, bulb and root pathogens that reduce yield and quality.\\nExcessive rains, humidity, temperature, pests and disease are critical factors of risk to onion cultivation. In\\naddition to adverse weather, during post-harvest period, lack of dormancy in bulbs, pest and disease infestation,\\nleads to excessive storage losses in onion and is a major concern of economic viability. About >40 diseases\\ncaused by fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes are reported across the globe in these crops. The major\\ndiseases are being purple blotch ( Alternaria porri ), Fusarium basal rot and Sclerotium  white rot and\\nColletotrichum neck rot and smudge are other important diseases of onion, causing bulb rot, during bulb\\nformation stage as well as during storage. Beside s these major pathogens, sometimes diseases caused by\\nStemphylium vesicarium, Phytophthora spp., Pythium spp., Botrytis spp. and Peronospora destructor causing\\nconsiderable yield losses, sometimes to the extent of 100% crop losses.\\nName of disease: PURPLE BLOTCH & STEMPHYLLIUM BLIGHT\\nGeographical origin, distribution and crop losses:  Purple blotch is one of the major foliar disease of onion\\nand garlic which significantly reduces the yield of the crop and cause heavy economic losses to growers. Purple\\nblotch disease is spread throughout the world and reduces yield up to onion bulb 97% (Kareem et al. 2012).\\nSymptoms: Purple blotch is a common disease of onion and garlic.  All above ground parts of the plant is\\nseverely affected.  The blotch usually appears on the oldest leaves. Thrips are pre-disposing factor for the\\npathogen infection.

Plant pathogenic Alternaria fungi secrete toxins as secondary metabolites which\\nled to the development of disease in the host plant by necrosis. Mycelium of A. porri is branched, coloured and\\nseptate. Conidiophores develop singly or in groups, septate. Conidiophores are solitary or found in groups and\\nare purple in the young stage and become brown when old. Conidia arise singly, they are straight or curved\\nand are pale to brown.

A. paeoniifolius ), commonly known as\\n‘zimikand’, ‘suran’ or simply elephant foot, is one of the most nutritious tuberous vegetable crops. It is\\ncommonly grown in India, China, Africa, other South-East Asian and Pacific countries. It is a rich source of\\ncarbohydrates, minerals (Ca, P etc.) and Vitamin A and B. The calcium oxalate crystals present in the corms\\nof wild species causes acridity and irritation and this can be overcome to a great extent by boiling. Apart\\nfrom vegetables, this is also used for various medicinal purposes. In India, this crop is traditionally cultivated\\nin West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Gujarat, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. These\\nnot only enrich the diet of people but also possess medicinal properties to cure many diseases. Several\\nabiotic and biotic stresses play an important role in the production and productivity of the crops. Among\\nthe biotic stresses, diseases are the key factors which determine the successful production of these crops.\\nDiseases can sometimes, be a limiting factor in the production of elephant foot yam. The crop is affected\\nby many diseases such as collar rot ( Sclerotium rolfsii ), mosaic disease ( Dasheen mosaiv virus  (DsMV), leaf\\nblight ( Phytophthora colocasiae),  corm rot ( Rhizoctonia  solani ), bacterial leaf blight ( Xanthomonas\\namorphophalli), root knot nematode ( Meloidogyne incognita) and lesion nematode ( Pratylenchus spp.) in\\nsome Southern states of the country.\\nName of disease: COLLAR ROT\\nGeographical origin, distribution and crop losses:  Collar rot caused by fungus Sclerotium rolfsii is the most\\nserious disease of EFY . The pathogen S. rolfsii is a destructive fungus affecting more than 500 plant species\\nof about 115 families and includes several important vegetable and other crops. The soil borne sclerotia\\nand wide host range of the fungus makes its control very difficult. The disease has been reported from\\nalmost all the EFY growing areas of India. The yield\\nlosses upto 100% has been reported due to this\\ndisease. Disease has been reported from all the states\\nof India.\\nSymptoms:  Crop is severely affected by disease with\\n32.9% incidence as complete killing of the plant.

The\\ncapability of producing highest dry matter, energy, and edible protein per unit area per unit time makes potato\\na fastest growing food crop especially in developing countries and that’s why it is regarded as the future crop\\nfor assuring food security. Globally potato occupies 19 million hectares area with a production of 388 million\\ntones. China and India respectively are the leading potato producing countries in the world and together they\\ncontribute to 38% of global potato produce. In India, potato is grown on 2.13 million hectares with production\\nand productivity of 53 million tonnes and 20.5 tonnes, respectively.\\nName of disease: LATE BLIGHT\\nGeographical origin, distribution & losses: Late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans is considered as the\\nmost threatening biotic stress for food security. The pathogen is considered as re-emerging due to regular\\nemergence of its novel strains with increased virulence and its appearance in new locations with surprising\\nintensity. Phytophthora infestans originated in the Americas; both central Mexico and the South American\\nAndes have been proposed as its centre of origin. The disease is widely distributed throughout the world but\\nis more serious in temperate highlands. Losses due to late blight have been estimated to • 12 billion per\\nannum of which the losses in developing countries are to the tune of • 10 billion per annum.\\nSymptoms: Late blight affects foliage, stems and tubers. It appears on leaves as water- soaked irregular pale\\ngreen lesions mostly near tip and margins which rapidly grow into large brown to purplish black necrotic spots\\n(\\nFig. 80a). A white mildew, which consists of sporangiophores and spores of the pathogen, can be seen on\\nlower surface of the infected leaves especially around the edges of the necrotic lesions (Fig. 80b). In dry weather\\nthe water-soaked areas dry up and turn brown. On stems and petioles light to dark brown lesions encircle the\\nstems as a result the affected stems and petioles become weak at such locations and may collapse. The pathogen\\ncan sporulate from stem lesions under very wet and moderate temperature conditions (Fig. 80c). Entire crop\\ngives blackened blighted appearance ( Fig. 80d ) especially under disease favorable conditions and may be\\ndestroyed within a week. Tubers in soil become infected by rain borne sporangia coming from the diseased\\nfoliage and show irregular reddish brown to purplish areas which extend into internal tissues of the tubers\\n(\\nFig. 80e). The infected tubers usually are hard, dry and firm but may get attacked by soft rot causing bacteria\\nand rot in field and stores. Sepals, flowers and berries ma y also get infected and show white mildew under\\nhumid and cloudy weather.\\nCausal organism & key characteristics: Late blight, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans (Mont.)\\nde Bary is heterothallic and requires two mating types (A1 and A2) for sexual reproduction. The pathogen is\\ncharacterized by lemon shaped detachable, papillate sporangia produced on sympodially branched'),\n",

The sporangiophores exhibit a characterized swelling at junction\\nwhere sporangia are attached with the sporangiophores. Sexual reproduction results in production of thick-\\nwalled oospores that can survive adverse conditions. The vegetative cells are diploid but higher ploidy levels\\nhave also been described. The genome size of the P. infestans is considerably larger (240 Mb) having an extremely\\nhigh repeat content (~74%), which is thought to contribute to P . infestans evolutionary potential by promoting\\ngenome plasticity, thus enhancing genetic variation of effector genes leading to host adaptation.\\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions: Both sexual and asexual reproductive cycles are operative; however,\\nthe asexual cycle predominates. Asexual cycle is the major contributor to the epidemics as many cycles in a\\nseason are rapidly produced. Sporangia are produced under conditions of high moisture and moderate\\ntemperature (10-24\\noC). Sporangia produced on leaf or stem lesions are dispersed by air currents or dislodged\\nby raindrops. Once in the air, sporangia can survive several hours under cloudy conditions, but only up to an\\nhour under sunny conditions. Sporangia germinate either dir ectly, by forming a germ tube (at temperature\\n>15\\noC), or indirectly, by producing zoospores (<15 oC). Under optimal conditions (18-22 oC), symptom\\ndevelopment takes place within 3 days while in another 2-3 days; pathogen starts sporulation from the infection\\nsite. Moderate temperatures (10-25\\noC) and very wet conditions (humidity near saturation) are required for\\nsporulation. The survival between cropping periods is often dependent on the survival of infected tubers.\\nThus, tuber infections are very important in the epidemiology of P . infestans in potatoes. In locations where A1\\nand A2 individuals coexist, hybrid oospores can be formed that can survive for months, perhaps years, in soil\\nand can act as source of primary inoculum.\\nFig. 80: (a-d) Late blight symptoms on various plant parts e) Late blight infected field'),\n",

No single\\napproach is effective, hence combination of approaches in an integrated manner are essential to combat this\\ndevastating disease.\\n\\x99 Reducing the primary source of inoculum is the critical management strategy as onset of epidemic can be\\ndelayed by 3 to 6 weeks if all primary infection from early potato is eliminated. This can be achieved by\\neliminating volunteers and cull piles, waste heap s, infected tubers, use of certified seed and resistant\\nvarieties, balanced fertilization, adequate space between rows and plants, rotation with non-host crops,\\nadequate hilling, harvest in dry conditions and when the tubers are mature. A sound crop rotation for 3 to\\n4 years is an effective way of reducing the risk of soil-borne inoculum as oospores can remain infectious\\nup to 48 months in soil. As soon as the weather conditions become congenial for late blight, irrigation\\nshould be stopped wherever applicable. Only light irrigation may be given later, if required.

However,  after prolonged storage severely diseased\\ntubers may become shriveled.\\nCausal organism & key characteristics: In the past, potato diseases caused by Alternaria species were described\\nas early blight (caused by A. solani) and brown spot (caused by A. alternata) disease. However, both diseases\\nare often observed together on the same leaves and initial early blight symptoms are like brown spot symptoms,\\nmaking them hard to discriminate. Recent studies have shown that the Alternaria population on potato is\\nmuch more elaborate than a two-species disease complex. Several research groups have reported both small-\\nspored species, such as A. tenuissima, A. arborescens  and A. infectoria, and large-spored species, such as A.\\ngrandis and A. tomatophila, residing on potato leaves. Ten species of Alternaria have been implicated to cause\\nfoliar diseases of potato worldwide. These include A. solani , A. alternata, A. tenuissima, A. dumosa, A.\\narborescens, A. infectoria, A. grandis, A. interrupta, A. longipes and A. arbusti. The sexual stage of the fungus\\nis not known. The asexual conidia are borne singly or in a chain on distinct conidiophores. Conidia are dark,\\nellipsoid to oblong with 9–11 transverse septa and tapered  to a long beak. The fungus is readily cultured on\\nartificial media where it produces a deeply pigmented gray/black hairy colony.  The mycelium is haploid and\\nseptate, becoming darkly pigmented with age. Sporulation in culture can be stimulated by exposure to\\nfluorescent light.  \\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: The pathogen overwinters primarily on infected crop debris. The\\ndark pigmentation of the mycelium increases resistance to lysis which extends the survival time in the soil.\\nThick-walled chlamydospores have been reported, but they are found infrequently. In mild climates the pathogen\\ncan survive from season to season on volunteer potato plants as well as other weedy Solanaceous hosts such\\nas horse nettle and nightshade. Warm, humid (24-29°C) environmental conditions are conducive to infection.\\nDesiccated germ tubes are able to renew growth when re-wetted, and, hence, infection can occur under\\nconditions of alternating wet and dry periods. Secondary spread of the disease results from conidia being\\ndispersed mainly by wind and occasionally by splashing rain or overhead irrigation. Early blight is considered\\npolycyclic with repeating cycles of new infection. Spores produced on foliar lesions also contaminate soil and\\ninfect tubers through wounds during harvest.\\nFig. 81: Symptoms of early blight disease on leaves\\na b'),\n",

It is prevalent in most potato growing regions of the world including India, North-\\nWest, Central Volga-Vyatka, Ural regions of Russian Federation, West and East Siberia, Far East, Baltic countries,\\nBelarus, woodlands of Ukraine, north and central regions of Kazakhstan and many other potato growing\\ncountries. In India, it has spread widely in most potat o growing regions. The disease kills potato sprouts,\\ncauses damping off of seedlings, delay crop emergence and reduce crop stand. The tuber quality is also affected\\nby the development of sclerotia on progeny tubers, thus their market value is reduced. Yield losses up to 35%\\nprimarily due to reduced crop stand have been reported\\n.\\nSymptoms: The most common symptoms of the disease appear on tubers as black irregular lumpy encrustations\\nof fungal sclerotia which stick to the surface of tubers (black scurf). Reddish brown lesions develop on stems\\nand often girdle them. Partial or complete girdling of the stems results in resetting  of plant tops, purple\\npigmentation, upward chlorosis or rolling of leaves. Formation of aerial tubers in axis of leaves due to\\ninterference with starch translocation, are also observed in the infected plants (\\nFig. 82). Other symptoms on\\ntubers could be cracking, malformation, pitting and stem end necrosis. The sexual or perfect stage of the\\npathogen appears on stem just above soil line as whitish grey mat or mycelial felt.

R. solani  consists of genetically defined\\npopulations that are distinguished by anastomosis between hyphae of the isolates belonging to the same\\n‘anastomosis group’ (AG). Fourteen different anastomosis groups viz., AG-1 to AG-10, AG-BI, AG-11, AG-12,\\nand AG-13 have been recognized. Isolates of R. solani from potato mostly belong to anastomosis group 3 (AG-\\n3). However, strains belonging to other anastomosis groups (AG-1, AG-2-1, AG-2-2, AG-4, AG-5, AG-7 and AG-\\n9) have also been isolated from potato stems, stolons, roots and tubers, as well as from soils in which potatoes\\nwere grown. In Central Mexico, in addition to AG-3, isolates of AG-2, 4, -5, and -7 have been collected from\\npotato plants and/or tubers from fields. In India, only AG-3 (PT) isolates of R. solani have been found responsible\\nfor black scurf and stem canker disease of potato. However, since pathogen is tuber-borne in nature, there is\\nevery possibility of introduction of other pathogenic AGs in India with import of seed/ ware potato.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: The pathogen is both soil and seed borne but the disease spreads to\\nnew growing areas primarily through sclerotia-covered seed tubers. Soil-borne infection emerges later in the\\nseason since the fungus needs some time to grow into proximity with its potato host. Sclerotia of the pathogen\\ngerminate between 8 to 30\\noC and invade emerging sprouts or potato stems. Optimum temperature for\\ngermination of sclerotia is 23oC and for development of stem lesions is 18oC. Very high summer temperatures\\nare not conducive for production of sclerotia and their survival. High soil temperature (28-32oC) and high soil\\nmoisture favor development of sclerotia. Sclerotial development on tubers is initiated depending on\\nenvironmental conditions. Maximum development of sclerotia takes place in the period between dehaulming\\nand harvest of the crop. Late harvested crops show more black scurf incidence. The host range of R. solani is\\nvery wide and the pathogen causes diseases of many economically important plants belonging to Solanaceae,\\nFabaceae, Asteraceae, Poaceae and Brassicaceae as well as other ornamental plants and forest trees.\\nManagement\\n\\x99 The use of healthy seed tubers free from sclerotia, seed tuber treatment with 3% boric acid (dip for 30\\nminutes/ spray) before cold storage, planting in relatively dry and warm soil with shallow covering of seed\\ntubers to achieve rapid crop emergence with less opportunity for the fungus to attack, two to four year\\ncrop rotation with cereals and legumes, soil solarization with transparent polyethylene mulching during\\nhot summer months especially in Indian subtropical plains has been found very effective for control of the\\ndisease.\\n\\x99\\n Bio-control agents such as Trichoderma viride, T. harzianum and fungicides such as benomyl, thiabendazole,\\ncarboxin, pencycuron and azoxystrobin have been reported effective for control of the disease.\\n\\x99 Boric acid and pencycuron are the two chemicals that are fr equently used by Indian farmers to control\\nblack scurf. Seed tubers treatment with boric acid is recommended before sprouting usually prior to cold\\nstorage whereas pencycuron applied to the sprouted tubers at planting achieved more than 97% disease\\ncontrol by penflufen (0.062, 0.083%) dip treatment of scurf infected tubers for 10 minutes.\\nReferences:\\nArora RK, Sagar V (2014) Tuber borne diseases of potato.

The disease causes greater\\nloss in USA, China, Bangladesh, Tunisia, Great Britain, Iran, Australia and Poland. Dry rot affects the crop stand\\nby preventing the formation of potato sprouts, resulting in losses of up to 25% and infection rates as high as\\n60% during storage. This disease causes post-harvest losses costing US producers US$100–250 million annually.\\nIn India, an estimated loss of 6-13% has been observed in cold stores. The amount of inoculum in the soil\\ndetermines the amount of yield loss, which can range from 25 to 60%.\\nSymptoms: The disease occurs in two phases i.e. in the field as wilt and in storage as dry rot. In the standing\\ncrop, wilt symptoms are comprised of common dropping of leaves followed by whole plant dying within a\\nweek. The uprooted plants can be observed for necrotic brown discoloration of vascular regions in the stem\\n(\\nFig. 83a ). The main plant sections that are immediately affected by dry rot disease are tubers. On tubers,\\nsymptoms appear as small brown lesions on surface (Fig. 83b ) which subsequently enlarge, appear dark,\\nsunken, and wrinkled producing white, pink, or blue pustules.

Potato wart does not kill its host plant.\\nBelow ground symptoms may not be evident until harvest.\\nCausal organism & key characteristics: Synchytrium\\nendobioticum (Schilberszky) Percival is an obligate, holocarpic, endobiotic parasite that does not produce\\nhyphae but sporangia, which contain motile zoospores. The fungus is obligate soil-borne and produces persistent\\nresting (winter) sporangia (sori) with a long life span of more than 30 years. The sori are released into the soil\\nfrom the decomposition of warts. Summer sporangia develop in infected potato tissue leading to secondary\\nzoospore infections and they are thin-walled and short-lived. Resting sporangia are golden brown, thick walled\\nand spheroidal. Numerous pathotypes of the fungus have been identified.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Resting sporangia germinate to release haploid zoospores which migrate\\nin soil water to infect susceptible host tissues. Z oospores encyst in host tissues and develop into sori which\\nrelease haploid zoospores into neighboring host cells thus resulting in secondary disease cycle. Host cells\\nsurrounding the infected ones are subject to hyperplasia and hypertrophy, resulting in the formation of warts.\\nSome zoospores conjugate and form a zygote which de velops into resting sporangia. These sporangia are\\nreleased into soil after the decay of host tissues. Inoculum is spread primarily by the movement of contaminated\\nsoil adhering to tubers, equipment, and other carriers. Cont aminated manure is also considered as means of\\ninoculum dispersal. Resting sporangia are dormant structures which can remain viable in soil for more than 30\\nyears. Water is required for the germination of summer and winter sporangia and for the dispersal of the\\nzoospores.

Although the first incidence of the disease was reported in the year 1970s, but\\nthe problem gained much consideration during 1990s due to severe losses in storage units of North America\\nand Europe. The disease has a worldwide distribution and huge economic importance owing to its incidence\\nin field and storage. There are reports of as high as 93% disease incidence. The lesion of this disease can cover\\n11-13 percent of the tuber’s surface area, the most of any skin blemish disease.\\nSymptoms: Small, localized, light brown, circular spots with\\nindistinct borders frequently enlarge to cover a considerable\\narea of the tuber are the characteristic symptoms of the disease.\\nAffected areas have a distinct silvery sheen, particularly if the\\nsurface is wet (\\nFig. 86 ). The quantity of conidia and\\nconidiophores on the lesions gives them a silvery appearance.\\nThese lesions increase the permeability of tuber skin, causing\\nweight loss and tuber shrinking. Extensive sporulation occurs in\\ndepressions and crevices on the tuber towards the stolon end\\nand the eyes. The infection can be seen on dead, decaying, and\\ndrying seed tubers below ground ev en after they have been\\nplanted. The scurf lesions are more definite and frequently have\\na sooty appearance caused by conidiophores and conidia.\\nCausal organism(s) & Key characteristics: Helminthosporium solani is the cause of silver scurf disease in\\npotatoes. The fungus develops hyaline mycelia on artificial media, which appear brown septate, branched,\\nand turns brown with age. Unbranched conidiophores are septate, with the conidia borne in whorls from the\\ndistal ends of the cells. Spores are 7-8 X 18-64 µm and have up to eight septa, and are dark brown, rounded at\\nthe base, and pointed at the ends.  Septate conidiophores have a tiny apex and a broader base, and melanized\\nconidia are produced in a basipetal sequence on them. On conidiophores, conidia have two to eight pseudosepta\\nthat create whorls.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Helminthosporium solani infects potato plants in the field and tubers\\nduring storage. The spread of the disease is through soil and seed, but seed potatoes are the original source of\\ninoculum. The pathogen possesses polycyclic lifecycle and produces enormous inoculum. High humidity is\\nnecessary for disease development. The longer mature tubers remain in the soil, the more severe the problem\\nbecomes. Minimum conditions for infection are 3°C with 90% relative humidity; however, the optimum\\ntemperature for fungal proliferation is 20-25°C.

The earliest record of this disease in India corresponds to the year 1921.\\nThe pathogen is widespread and occurs in most potato-producing areas of the world.  It is primarily a disease\\nof cool climates. Powdery scab of potato is currently observed in northern Asia, Europe, North and South\\nAmerica, Australia, and New Zealand. It can be found in India’s high temperate highlands above 2500 metres.\\nThe disease can have a negative impact on the export trade, particularly of seed tubers.\\nSymptoms: The disease has no foliar or above-ground symptoms. The\\nfirst symptoms of powdery scab visible to the naked eye are small,\\nusually purple-brown pimple-like swellings up to 2 mm in diameter\\nseen most frequently at the rose (distal) end of young tubers. Powdery\\nscab lesions, unlike normal scab, are spherical, elevated, packed with\\na powdery mass of spores, and surrounded by perforated epidermal\\nlayers (\\nFig. 87 ). These lesions have a scab-like appearance and are\\nfilled with fine brown powder consisting predominantly of cystosori.\\nCystosori, also known as sporeballs, are aggregates of individual cysts\\n(resting spores) of the pathogen.  Small galls may develop on the roots\\nof affected plants. In storage, the infected tuber may shrivel and develop rot symptoms.\\nCausal organism(s) & Key characteristics: Powdery scab is caused by Spongospora subterranea. S. subterranea\\nsurvives, possibly for many years in a quiescent form as uninucleate or often binucleate thick-walled resting\\nspores that are so resistant to adverse conditions that they can survive passage through the alimentary canal\\nof farm animals. Individual resting spores are about 4 mm in diameter, but they are normally clumped together\\nas cystosori. Each cystosorus is an irregular sphere or ovoid, 19–85 mm across, and usually has a hollow centre\\noften with smaller pores between adjacent sori. These spaces contribute to the spongy nature of the spore\\nFig. 87: Powdery scab lesions on tuber'),\n",

It can live for up to 6 years in the soil. Under favourable conditions, and only in the presence of\\nliquid water, the resting spores germinate, each one releasing usually, and possibly always, a single uninucleate\\nzoospore through a circular hole in the wall of the sorus.

The plasmodium generates sporangia,\\nwhich produce up to eight secondary zoospores. The zoospores re-infect the host tissue, and under perfect\\nconditions, multiple generations of zoospores can be produced in a single season. The plasmodium produces\\nresting spore in the tuber, which can survive the winter and persist in the tuber and soil for a long time.

After row closure, little inverted trumpet-shaped\\nstructures known as apothecia can be found under the vine cover.\\nCausal organism(s) & Key characteristics: The disease is caused\\nby a fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The fungus produces white\\nand fluffy mycelia on the culture media. It overwinters as hard\\nsclerotia in the soil. Tiny globose spermatia also appear in the\\nmycelia mat in the rhizosphere of infected plant. Sclerotia\\ngerminate in the spring and create apothecia (Funnel shaped to\\nflat), which are little inverted mushroom-like structures that\\nshoot spores into potato leaf. These apothecia vary in colour ranging from pale, tan, pink, white to brown. Asci\\nare hyaline, eight spored and cylidroclavate. Ascospores are oval hyaline with narrow base and inflated apex.\\nThe importance of spores produced in the potato field for infection is greater than that of spores produced\\noutside the field.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Soilborne sclerotia near the surface germinate, forming either an\\napothecium or, if enough moisture and organic matter are available, a mycelial mat. The mycelium penetrates\\nstems at the soil line and forms a white, fluffy mat on the stem and adjacent soil. The fungus invades plant\\ntissues rapidly, entering the inner stem tissues and pith, where sclerotia are formed. Apothecia forcefully eject\\nnumerous ascospores at maturity. Ascospores may spread a considerable distance from the source, settle on\\nlateral branches or leaf surfaces, germinate, infect, and cause lesions. Spores can also directly infect the stem.\\nSclerotia can also germinate and infect the plant directly. Cool temperatures (16-22°C) and high relative humidity\\n(95-100%) favor disease development. Sclerotia are killed within 3-6 weeks in flooded fields. Heavy rainfall or\\nirrigation induces apothecia production from sclerotia.\\nManagement:\\n\\x99 Management of this pathogen is very difficult because of its wide host range and persistent sclerotia.\\nHowever, cultural practices, such as removal and burning of infected plant debris, eradication of weed\\nhosts may suppress the disease incidence.\\n\\x99\\n Crop rotation with non-susceptible hosts for four or more years will help minimize sclerotinia rot in\\nsubsequent potato plantings.\\n\\x99 By increasing spacing, reducing vine growth, and irrigating less frequently, it may be possible to manage\\nthe outbreak.\\n\\x99 Foliar applications of protectant fungicides at row closure to coincide with ascospore release can limit the\\ndisease.\\nReferences:\\nOjaghian MR (2009) First report of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum  on potato plants in Iran.

Aus Plant Dis Notes, 4(1):\\n80-81.\\nName of disease: SCLEROTIUM ROT\\nGeographical origin, distribution & crop losses: The disease is serious in warm humid regions. The fungus was\\nnamed Sclerotium rolfsii by Saccardo in 1911. S. rolfsii has an extensive host range; at least 500 species in 100\\nfamilies are susceptible. The most common hosts are the legumes, crucifers, and cucurbits. This pathogen has\\nbeen reported on potato in several countries such as India, Israel, Italy, and the United States of America.\\nSymptoms: Plants with sclerotium stem rot first show a\\nmoist decay at or just below the soil surface ( Fig. 89).\\nStem lesions can spread up and down the stem, infecting\\nall plant sections. Wilting and yellowing of the leaves\\nare symptoms of stem infection. Usually, the plants wilt\\nand bear chlorotic leaves. An appressed, cottony fanlike\\nmycelial growth emerges over the soil surface, and\\nminute round, tan sclerotia form in the older mycelia at\\nthe stem base and soil surface. Initially, infected tissues\\nare soft, depressed, and brownish. As the dead cortical\\nstem tissues dry out, xylem remains as fibrous strands.\\nStolons are the most common way for tubers to become\\ninfected. Lenticels may also facilitate the mycelial entry\\nthat establishes infection in the tubers. Fresh lenticel\\nlesions produce moist, firm and cheesy lesions. These lesions are easily dislodged and leave a cavity. The\\ncircular lesions become white and chalky after drying.\\nCausal organism(s) & Key characteristics: The causal fungus Sclerotium rolfsii bears white hyaline septate\\nmycelium on the surface of incubated tubers and on PDA. Light to dark brown sclerotia 1 to 2 mm in diameter\\ndevelop from the mycelium which are initially white but turn brown at later stages. Older mycelia usually form\\nstrands of pigmented hyphae. Sclerotia are numerous, round, 0.4-2.0 mm in diameter, white when young,\\nthen tan, and dark brown when old. The basidiospores of approximately 3.5-5 X 6-7 µm, elliptical to obovate,\\nappear. Thick clamp connection is observed in the developing mycelia.\\nDisease cycle and favourable conditions: The fungus is soilborne as selerotia or mycelia on dead and decaying\\norganic matter . Sclerotia permit long-term survival but possess low energy reserve. They produce short-lived\\nmycelia unless a suitable living or dead plant part is available. Mycelia infect seed tubers, sprouts, grown\\nplants at any stage, and tubers. As an energy supply is exhausted, the mycelia aggregate, and sclerotia are\\nformed. The fungus survives in the soil in off seasons. Hot temperatures (80° to 90°F) and moist soil surfaces\\nenhance germination and sclerotia infection. Only hot climate growth locations are thought to be affected by\\nSclerotium stem rot. The fungus can infect both living and dead vines. If the fungus is present, extensive tuber\\nlosses might begin within a few days after harvest.\\nManagement\\n\\x99 The fields infested with S. rolfsii should be avoided in succeeding seasons and should follow crop rotation\\nwith non-fleshy crops.\\nFig. 89: Symptoms of Sclerotium rot on collar region\\nPotato'),\n",

Recently, Brazil is considered as one of the hypothetical centres of origin of R. solanacearum\\nbecause of high genetic variability of R. solanacearum as brown rot ecotypes is autochthonous in South America,\\nmore precisely in Brazil and Peru. The diseaseis widespread  in tropical and subtropical parts of Asia, Africa,\\nSouth and Central America and in some soils and waterways in Europe and Australia. Bacterial wilt has been\\nestimated to affect potato crop in 3.75 million acres in approximately 80 countries with global damage estimates\\nexceeding $950 million per year. Strains of this pathogen affect more than 450 plant species in over 54 botanical\\nfamilies throughout the world, including a wide range of crop plants, ornamentals and weeds. In India, losses\\nup to 75 per cent have been recorded under extreme conditions.\\nSymptoms: The earliest symptom of the disease is slight wilting in leaves of top branches during hot sunny\\ndays. The leaves show drooping due to loss of turgidity followed by total unrecoverable wilt (Fig. 90a). In well-\\nestablished infections, cross-sections of stems reveal brown discoloration of infected tissues ( Fig. 90b ). In\\nadvanced stages of wilt, cut end of base of the stem may show dull white ooze on squeezing. Bacterial wilt in\\nfield can be distinguished from other fungal wilts by placing the stem cut sections in clear water. Within a few\\nminutes, a whitish thread like streaming can be observed coming out from cut end into water (\\nFig. 90c). This\\nstreaming represents the bacterial ooze exuding from the cut ends of colonized vascular bundles. The same\\ntest can also be carried out to see infection in tuber.\\nFig. 90: Symptoms of bacterial wilt (a) wilting of plants infected with R. solanacearum, (b) brown discoloration of stem\\ntissues, and (c) bacterial streaming in clear water from cut section of potato stem'),\n",

In\\nvascular rot, the vascular tissues of a transversely cut tuber show dirty white glistening sticky drops of bacterial\\nooze appearing from the brownish vascular ring within about 2-3 minutes (\\nFig. 91b). Another type of symptom\\nis observed as lesions formed on tuber. Such lesions are produced due to infection of the bacterium through\\nlenticels (skin pore).

This is non-spore forming, non-encapsulated,\\nnitrate reducing and ammonia forming bacterium. The pathogen under oxygen stress conditions in culture\\nmedia shift to avirulent form. Lipopolysacchrides of the pathogen play an important role in determination of\\nvirulence. Virulent isolates on tetrazolium chloride medium develop fluidal irregular shaped colonies with\\nwhite to pinkish centre whereas avirulent types produce small round, dark red dry colonies.\\nStrains of R. solanacearum have conventionally been classified into five races (related to the ability to wilt\\nmembers of the family Solanaceae (r1), banana (r2), potato and tomato in temperate conditions (r3), ginger\\n(r4) and mulberry (r5), and six biovars (bvs) (metabolic profiles related to the ability to metabolize a panel of\\nthree sugar alcohols and three disaccharides). Based on variation of DNA sequences, R. solanacearum has\\nbeen classified into four phylotypes in a species complex namely, Phylotype I (strains of Asiatic origin), Phylotype\\nII (American origin),  Phylotype III (African highlands and Indian ocean) and Phylotype IV (Strains in Indonesia).\\nRecently, it has been reclassified into three distinct species: R. solanacearum  (Phylotype II), R.\\npseudosolanacearum  (Phylotype I and II) and R. syzygii  (Phylotype IV). Ralstonia syzygii  comprise three\\nsubspecies: subsp. syzgii found on clove, sub sp. celebesensis found on banana and sub sp. indonesiensis found\\non potato, tomato, capsicum and clove.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Infected tubers and plant debris in infested soil are two major sources\\nof inoculum. The pathogen infects roots of healthy plants through wounds. Nematodes such as Meloidogyne\\nincognita which affect potato roots and tubers increase wilt incidence. Inoculum potential of about 10 7 cfu/g\\nsoil favours infection which however is dependent on other predisposing factors. Race 1 has greater ability to\\nsurvive in soil than race 3 because of the better c ompetitiveness; wide host range and higher aggressiveness\\nof race 1. Mean soil temperature below 15\\noC and above 35 oC do not favour the disease development.

Ralstonia solanacearum is capable of causing brown rot in a wide range\\nof soil types and levels of acidity. In majority of the cases, the disease has been reported in acidic soils (pH 4.3\\nto 6.8) and only in a few cases in alkaline soils. Several other factors that affect pathogen survival in soil and\\nwater also affect disease development. The soil type and physicochemical properties have significant influence\\non survival of the pathogen. Soils having high clay and silt content with higher water holding capacity are\\nfavourable for long survival while high sand contents disfavor its survival. Also, soil moisture and temperature\\nexert a combined effect on survival of the pathogen. The congenial conditions for slow decline of population\\nand virulence for race 1 and 3 are temperature between 10-30\\noC, soil moisture between 20-60 WHC, heavy\\nsoils and aerobic conditions.\\nManagement\\n\\x99 The control of bacterial wilt has proven to be very difficult because of both the seed and soil borne nature\\nof the pathogen and especially in the case of race 1 due to its broad host range. Chemical control is nearly\\nimpossible. Soil fumigants have shown either slight or no effects. Antibiotics such as streptomycin,\\nampicillin, tetracycline and penicillin hardly have any effect; in fact, streptomycin application increased\\nthe incidence of bacterial wilt in Egypt.\\n\\x99\\n Use of healthy planting material can take care of almost 80% of bacterial wilt problem. Tubers should not\\nbe cut since the cutting knife spreads the disease and cut tubers can contact disease from soil easily.\\n\\x99 Following 2-3-year crop rotation using crops like maize, cereals, garlic, onion, cabbage and sanai (sun\\nhemp) can help in reduction of the disease. Care should be taken not to rotate vegetables like brinjal,\\nginger, chillies and other solanaceous crops which may act as alternate hosts. As the pathogen perpetuates\\nin the root system of many weeds and crops, the fields should be cleaned of weeds and root/foliage\\nremnants. Soil solarisation and deep ploughing of fields together during summer season in subtropical\\nplains can helps in reduction of field inoculum.\\n\\x99\\n Potato cultivars developed in Colombia with a Solanum phureja  and S. demissum  background showed\\nresistance to R. solanacearum, but the race and strain diversity of the pathogen made it difficult to utilize\\nthese in other countries. The absolute control of bacterial wilt, at present, is difficult to achieve, however,\\neconomic losses can be brought down considerably using the eco-friendly package of practices.\\n\\x99 Soil application of stable bleaching powder @ 12 kg/ ha mixed with fertilizers at planting gives good\\ncontrol of bacterial wilt.

In India, it was known to occur in Lahaul Valley (Himachal Pradesh) in\\nsevere form since 1969; its frequent occurrence in plains was reported in 1979-1980. Afterwards, it became a\\nmajor problem in almost all agro climatic zones of India.Now, the disease has covered almost all the potato\\ngrowing areas of the country and is posing a serious threat to successful potato cultivation. Common scab\\ncauses superficial lesions on surface of potato tubers and affects quality of the produce. The affected tubers\\nfetch low price in market due to poor appearance and because deeper peeling is required before consumption.\\nSeed lots exceeding 5 per cent incidence is rejected by seed certification agencies (in India) causing huge\\nloss to seed industry.\\nSymptoms: Scab begins as small reddish or brownish spot\\non the surface of the potato tubers and its initial infection\\ntakes place during juvenile period of tubers. Infection takes\\nplace mainly through lenticels and surrounding periderm\\nturns brown and rough. Lesion becomes corky due to\\nelongation and division of invaded cells. Under Indian\\nconditions multiple kinds of symptoms have been recorded\\nand they are grouped as (1) a mere brownish roughening or\\nabrasion of tuber skin (2) proliferated lenticels with hard\\ncorky deposition, might lead to star shaped lesion (3) raised\\nrough and corky pustules (4) 3-4 mm deep pits surrounded\\nby hard corky tissue (5) concentric series of wrinkled layers\\nof cork around central black core (\\nFig. 93).\\nCausal organism(s) & Key characteristics: At least 13 different Streptomyces spp. have been found to cause\\ncommon scab on potato worldwide. The prominent among them are Streptomyces scabies (Thaxter) Lambert\\nand Loria, S. acidiscabies Bambert and Loria, S. turgidscabis Takeunchi, S. collinus Lindenbein; S. griseus (Krainsky)\\nWaksman & Henria Henria, S. longisporoflavus, S. cinereus, S. violanceoruber, S. alborgriseolus, S. griseoflavus,\\nS. catenulae and others. Streptomces are bacteria which resemble fungi due to formation of vegetative substrate\\nmycelium that develop aerial filaments. However, the filaments are of smaller dimensions than the true fungi.\\nThese filaments produce spores through fragmentation. Streptomyces  spp. may be pathogenic or non-\\npathogenic. The pathogenic species produce thaxtomins which are phytotoxins and cause hypertrophy and\\ncell death. Considerable variation exists within the pathogen with respect to their pigment production in\\nmedia, colour and shape of sporulating filaments and use of specific sugars. The identification and taxonomy\\nof Streptomyces spp. has been based on morphological and physiological characteristics combined with\\nthaxtomin production and pathogenicity tests in-vitro and in-vivo\\n.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Potato is physiologically most susceptible to Streptomyces sp. in the\\nperiod following tuber initiation. Streptomyces sp. infects the newly formed tubers through stomata and\\nimmature lenticels. Once the periderm has differentiated, tubers are no longer susceptible to the pathogen.\\nThe pathogen is both seed and soil borne. It can survive in soil for several years in plant debris and infested\\nsoil. Soil conditions greatly influence the pathogen survival. Favorable conditions include pH between 5.2\\nto 8.0 or more, temperature in the range of 20 to 30°C and low soil moisture. The pathogen is aerobic in\\nFig. 93: Different types of scab symptoms caused\\nby Streptomyces species on potato tubers'),\n",

The disease affects the crop at all stages of growth, but it is more serious on potato tubers under poor\\nstorage conditions especially in warm and wet climate. Bacterial soft rot can cause significant loss of potato\\ntubers at harvest, transit and storage. Losses due to poor handling of the produce, poorly ventilated storage or\\ntransit may go up to 100 per cent. Soft rot bacteria usually infect potato tubers which have been damaged by\\nmechanical injury or in the presence of other tuber borne pathogens. Bacterial soft rot develops much faster\\nunder warm and humid conditions. The disease also results in blackleg of foliage during the crop growing\\nseason\\n.\\nSymptoms: Initially a small area of tuber tissue around lenticels or stolon attachment point becomes water\\nsoaked and develops soft lesions ( Fig. 94a). Under low humidity, the initial soft rot lesions may become dry\\nand sunken. Under high humidity, the lesions may enlarge and spread to larger area.

The tuber skin remains intact\\nand sometimes the rotten tubers are swollen due to gas\\nformation. At harvest, many small rotten tubers with intact\\nskin can be seen. The infected seed tubers rot before\\nemergence resulting in poor stand of the crop. In cooler\\nregions, another kind of symptoms called black leg phase\\ndevelops from soft rot infected seed tubers. The affected\\nhaulms become black at collar region just above the ground.\\nInfected plants develop yellowing, start wilting and die early\\nwithout producing any tubers. Water soaked lesions develop\\non succulent stems, petioles, and leaves. On stem and\\npetioles, the lesions first enlarge into stripes, turn black (\\nFig. 94b ) and then invade the affected parts\\ncausing soft rot and toppling of the stem and leaves .\\nCausal organism(s) & Key characteristics: Pectobacterium atrosepticum  (van Hall) (syn. Erwinia carotovora\\nsub sp. atroseptica), Pectobacterium carotovorum sub sp. carotovorum (Jones) (syn. Erwinia carotovora subsp.\\ncarotovora), Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense (Erwinia carotovora sub sp. brasiliense) (Pcb),\\nPectobacterium wasabiae  ( Erwinia carotovora  sub sp. wasabiae) (Pwa) and several Dickeya spp. ( Erwinia\\nchrysanthemi), including D. dianthicola (Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. dianthicola), Dickeya dadantii, Dickeya zeae\\n(Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. zeae) and the new species Dickeya solani are known to cause potato blackleg disease\\nin field and tuber soft rots in storage and in transit . P . atrosepticum, the primary enterobacteria causing soft\\nrots, produce pectolytic enzymes and degrade pectin in middle lamella of host cells, breakdown tissues and\\ncause soft rot and the decay. The decaying tissue become slimy and foul smelling and brown liquid oozes out\\nfrom the soft rot affected tubers. About 1500 strains of pectinolytic Erwinia have been isolated from infected\\nplants and tubers. The pathogen produces certain volatile compounds such as ammonia, trimethylamine and\\nseveral volatile sulfides and early detection of such volatile compounds in storage could be used as a method\\nto detect the disease at initial stage.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Soft rot bacteria may be carried latently deep inside the tuber in\\nlenticels, wounds and on surface of tubers without any visible symptoms and spread to healthy tubers in\\nstores, during seed cutting, handling and planting. Water film on surface of tuber which cause proliferation of\\nlenticels and creates anaerobic conditions and injury on surface of tuber predispose potatoes to soft rot. From\\nsoft rot infected seed tubers bacteria may enter vascular tissues of developing stems and can develop black\\nleg under favorable conditions. From black leg infected plants, the pathogen can reach daughter tubers through\\nstolons and initiate tuber decay at the site of tuber attachment.  Decaying tubers in soil could serve as source\\nof contamination for healthy tubers. The threshold level for disease development is about 10\\n3 cells of E.\\ncarotovora sub sp. atroseptica per tuber. Tubers harvested in wet soil, poor ventilation in transit and storage\\npromotes the rot.\\nIn warm climates, where one potato crop follows another or where only short rotation cycles are applied, the\\nbacteria can pass easily from one crop to the next, especially in poorly drained soil. The bacteria can be\\ndisseminated in the potato fields by irrigation water, insects, rain or bacterial aerosols. The pathogen may also\\nspread through water during washing of the produce with contaminated water. Soft rot causing bacteria spread\\neasily from diseased to healthy tubers during storage, handling and grading. Insects especially maggots of\\nHylemyia species may also transmit the bacteria from one tuber to another\\n.\\nThere are controversial reports on survival of Erwinias in soil. In temperate zones, the bacteria can survive\\nthe winter on plant residues, however, no survival has been observed in fields rotated with non-hosts\\nFig. 94: a) Soft rot symptoms on tubers b)\\nblack leg symptoms on stem'),\n",

In nature it is\\nlargely confined to members of the family Solanaceae. Yield losses of 15–20% can occur with widespread\\ninfection of PVX. The virus interacts with PVY and PVA to cause more severe symptoms and still higher yield\\nloss than either virus alone.\\nSymptoms: Plants infected with PVX often remain symptomle ss. When symptoms are expressed, there is a\\npattern of light and dark green on leaflets, the lighter, small, irregular blotches occur between the veins. Only\\noccasionally does leaf distortion, rugosity, necrotic spotting or stunting occur. PVX can interact with PVY and\\nPVA to cause more severe symptoms such as rugose mosaic (PVX+PVY) and crinkle mosaic (PVX+PVA) resulting\\nin higher yield loss.\\nCausal organisms & Key characteristics: PVX has filamentous virions of 515x13 nm and single stranded RNA.PVX\\nbelongs to the family Alphaflexiviridae and the order Tymovirales. It is the type species of the genus Potexvirus.\\nStrains of PVX have been classified into four groups according to their reactions with the dominant resistance\\ngenes Nb and Nx and with the extreme resistance gene Rx. Group 1 strains cause a hypersensitive response in\\nthe presence of Nb or Nx, group 2 only with Nb, group 3 only with Nx and group 4 with neither and fails to\\ninfect plants carrying Rx gene. Based on serology, two serotypes can be distinguished: serotype PVX\\nO (common\\nor worldwide distributed) and PVXA (restricted to some regions in Peru and Bolivia).\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Transmission of PVX is by contact, either plant to plant or by\\nhumans, animals or machinery passing through a crop. PVX is highly contagious. Once attached to a surface\\nsuch as clothing the virus can remain infective for many hours provided the surface remains wet.

PVX is not transmitted by true seed or by aphids. PVX can spreads rapidly in poorly cared crop\\nresulting in up to 50% or more infection with in 3-4 cycles of cultivation.\\nName of disease: POTATO VIRUS Y (PVY)\\nGeographical origin, distribution & Crop losses: PVY is one of the most economically important viruses of\\npotato worldwide. It can cause up to 80 % yield reduction. PVY O occurrence is worldwide. However, PVY N\\nand PVYNTN strains are limited to certain countries, and therefore, are of quarantine significance. PVY Z and\\nPVYE have also been reported but these are considered to be of lesser significance in potato production. In\\naddition to these strains, recombination led to the evolution of new strains of PVY like PVY NTN, PVYNW and\\nPVYNTN-NW. PVYC strain has been reported from India, Australia and Europe.\\nSymptoms: Generally, the symptoms vary with the strains of the virus and\\nvariety of potato. In general, the affected plants are stunted with mild or\\nsevere mosaic and veinal necrosis. Original strain of PVY\\nO causes mosaic,\\nnecrotic spots, mild rugosity and drying of leaves whereas, PVY C usually causes\\nstipple-streak or necrotic veins/stars. PVY NTN strains cause severe superficial\\ntuber necrosis and may also causes necrotic foliar symptoms ( Fig. 95).\\nCausal organisms & Key characteristics: PVY are flexuous, long filamentous,\\n740 x 11 nm sized particles. PVY is a type member of the genus Potyvirus of the\\nfamily Potyviridae. The potato PVY isolates are classified into different strain groups based on their mosaic\\nor necrotic symptoms developed on tobacco and resistance gene interaction involving elicitation of specific\\nHR genes. Initially, they were divided into three strains: PVY\\nC, PVY O, and PVY N but later two more strain\\ngroups PVY Z and PVY E were added. PVY O and PVY N are the most frequent in potato whereas PVY C is not\\ncommon in potato fields and thus of comparatively less economic importance. PVY Z and PVY E have also\\nbeen reported less frequently.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Infected seed tubers or seed material is the main sources of PVY\\ninoculum in tropical countries. Aphids (Myzus persicae) probing on potato plants are potential vectors of PVY\\nwhich transmit the virus to other healthy plants. Tubers formed by the infected plant act as primary source of\\ninoculum for the next year crop. Further, a combination of high humidity (80-90%) and moderate temperature\\n(25-30°C) increase virus transmission by aphids. However, the transmission of this virus is reduced significantly\\nwhen RH falls below 50%.\\nName of disease: POTATO VIRUS A (PVA)\\nGeographical origin, distribution & Crop losses: PVA has worldwide distribution. In India it is most often\\nobserved as combined infections with PVX and PVY . PVA alone can cause 30-40 % yield reduction while it is still\\nhigher in case of co-infections with PVX and PVY .\\nSymptoms: Potato virus A (PVA) causes mild mosaic symptoms somewhat similar to those caused by Potato\\nvirus X (PVX). However, unlike PVX the mottles caused by PVA appear on the veins and the infected leaves look\\nshiny. Infected plants show an open habit. Severe leaf crinkle may be produced in combination with PVX.\\nCausal organisms & Key characteristics: PVA virus particles are flexuous 730 x 11 nm long filaments. It is\\nserologically closely related to PVY . PVA belongs to genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae with single stranded\\npositive sense RNA. Three strain groups of Potato virus have been reported based on their response in potato.\\nPVA\\n-U caused systemic necrosis in potato cv.

Thus, PVA -U, PVA-M and PVA -B11 represented distinct strains of PVA, namely\\nPVA-1, PVA -2 and PVA -3, respectively.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: At least seven aphid species are capable of transmitting PVA\\nincluding Aphis frangulae, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, and Myzus persicae . The virus is non-persistent and\\nis lost from aphids as they go through their life cycle. As with PVY , the virus can be acquired rapidly from an\\ninfected plant (<1 minute) and transmitted equally rapidly. The transmission and life cycle of infected\\ntubers are almost similar to PVY . PVA naturally infects only potato crop however, this virus can infect a few\\nSolanaceaeous  species.\\nName of disease: POTATO VIRUS S (PVS)\\nGeographical origin, distribution & Crop losses: PVS occurs worldwide. It is the most frequently found virus in\\npotato. An incidence of 8.5 to 99.5% has been recorded in Indian potatoes at different locations. Reduction in\\ntuber yield is very low but may go up to 10-20% or more when combined with PVX.\\nSymptoms: PVSO is symptomless on most potato cultivars, with occasional mild leaf symptoms of rugosity,\\nvein deepening and bronzing. PVS A has been found to produce stronger symptoms, including premature\\nsenescence and loss of leaves, especially in secondarily infected plants. However, symptoms such as rugosity,\\nmosaic, stunting, bronzing, vein deepening, early drop of leaves, and fine necrotic spots on lower leaves have\\nalso been reported occasionally in some cultivars.\\nCausal organisms & Key characteristics: PVS belongs to the genus Carlavirus, family Betaflexiviridae. PVS\\nconsists of flexuous particles containing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 8.4Kb.\\nThe genomes of most Carlavirus contain positive single-stranded RNA of 5.8 to 9kb and two subgenomic\\nmRNAs of 2.1-3.3 kb and 1.3-1.6 kb. Two strain groups of PVS have been recognized viz., PVS\\nO (Ordinary) and\\nPVSA (Andean) based on non-systemic and systemic infection in Chenopodium spp. Both PVSO and PVSA produce\\nchlorotic local lesions on sap inoculation to C. amaranticolor and C. quinoa and in addition PVSA induce systemic\\nchlorosis. These two strains can also be identified by the differences in nucleotide sequences or amino acid\\nsequences of the 7K protein, CP , and nucleotide-binding (11K) protein at the genetic level.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: In the field, PVS is transmitted primarily by contact than by aphids.\\nPVS can be transmitted by Aphis fabae, A. nasturtii, Myzus persicae, and Rhopalosiphum padi in a non-persistent\\nmode or via vegetative propagation or naturally mechanical inoculation to the Solanaceae and Chenopodiaceae.\\nPVS usually spreads slowly in the field. Spreading of PVS A might faster than PVS O, because of higher virus\\nconcentrations and additional transmission by Myzus persicae and other aphid species. Tubers also carry the\\nvirus. PVS being occurs as most frequent natural contaminant along with PVX, and/or PVY and PVM. The virus\\nis transmitted through contact and by several aphid species in a non-persistent manner.\\nName of disease: POTATO VIRUS M (PVM)\\nGeographical origin, distribution & Crop losses: Potato virus M  (PVM) has worldwide distribution. It can\\ncause 15-45% reduction in potato yield in heavily infected varieties.\\nSymptoms: PVM causes mottle, mosaic, crinkling, rolling of leaves and stunting of shoots. Severity of symptoms\\ngreatly depends on the combination of potato cultivars and PVM isolates.\\nCausal organisms & Key characteristics: PVM has a single-stranded, polyadenylated, positive-sense genomic\\nRNA of appropriately 8.5 kb in length. PVM is a member of the genus Carlavirus of the family Flexviridae. As\\nper our literature search there are no reports on strains of PVM.\\nPotato'),\n",

It is mostly found in the Solanaceae family. The infected plants may 50% or more reduction in\\nyield. PLRV is probably the most important potato virus worldwide. According to one assessment, the virus\\nis to blame for Global yield loss of 20 million tonnes.\\nSymptoms: The primary symptoms are confined to top young\\nleaves, which usually stand upright, roll and turn slightly pale\\nin certain cultivars (\\nFig. 96 ). Most varieties, however, develop\\nreddish/pink colour in top leaves starting at the margins,\\nsometimes accompanied with slight rolling of the leaflets.\\nSecondary symptoms develop when the plants are grown from\\ninfected seed tubers. Such symptoms are rather prominent in\\nolder leaves, i.e. absent or less pronounced on younger top\\nleaves. Infected plants have characteristic pale, dwarfed, and\\nupright appearance with rolling of lower leaves that turn yellow,\\nbrittle and are leathery in texture. In some cultivars, a reddish\\nor purple discolouration develops on the margins and underside of the leaves.\\nCausal organisms & Key characteristics: PLRV is the second most important virus of potato globally and\\npertain to the family Luteoviridae and genus Polerovirus. PLRV has small, isometric virions (23-25 nm dia)\\nwhich are primarily confined to the phloem of the infected plants. The genome of PLRV is monopartite,\\nsingle stranded, non-enveloped with a positive sense RNA of 5882 nucleotides in length.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: The virus is tuber borne, transmitted efficiently by aphid in a\\npersistent manner. Primary infections are normally caused by the viruliferous aphids coming either from\\ndistant or nearby fields and/or diseased volunteer plants arising from the infected tubers. Potato plants\\ninfected with PLRV will produce infected tubers. If infected tubers are planted, they will give rise to\\ninfected plants. The green peach aphid ( Myzus persicae) is the most efficient and important vector of PLRV.\\nThe virus is also spread by Aphis gossypii . Macrosiphum euphorbiae which transmits potato strains less\\nefficiently. Virus accumulates in tubers and such tubers transmit the virus to the daughter tubers and to\\nthe foliage.\\nName of disease: TOMATO LEAF CURL NEW DELHI VIRUS (TOLCNDV)\\nGeographical origin, distribution & Crop losses: Apical leaf curl disease of potato was observed in 1999\\nfrom Northern India. Association of a begomovirus was confirmed and it was found as a strain of Tomato\\nleaf curl New Delhi virus .  About 40-100 % of infection has been recorded in Indo-Gangetic plains and Hisar\\narea of India with heavy yield losses in susceptible varieties. Significant decrease in size and number of\\ntubers lead to marketable yield loss as high as 50% in early planted susceptible cultivars.\\nFig. 96: Primary symptoms of PLRV on young\\nleaves'),\n",

In case of seed borne infection, the entire\\nplant shows the symptoms leaf distortion with mosaic accompanied with\\nsevere stunting of the plant (\\nFig. 97). The symptoms are so severe that it can\\nbe identified easily, but such symptoms are expressed only when the\\nconcentration of virus is very high. However, in many cases the symptoms\\nare recovered as the maximum temperature fall below 28°C. If the virus\\nconcentration is less the leaves show rolling which is just like symptoms\\ncaused by Potato virus M (PVM).\\nCausal organisms & Key characteristics: Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus-\\npotato (ToLCNDV-potato) belongs to the genus Begomovirus within the family\\nGeminiviridae.This virus is a variant of a bipartite begomovirus, Tomato leaf\\ncurl New Delhivirus  (ToLCNDV) with altered properties is sap-transmissible and is able to infect potato. The\\nvirus has 93–95% sequence identity with ToLCNDV isolates and <75% sequence identity with other Tomato\\nleaf curl virus  isolates and Potato yellow mosaic virus .\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: Begomoviruses are transmitted by Bemisia tabaci in a circulative\\nand persistent manner. Increase in populations of B. tabaci is a general characteristic of begomovirus\\ndisease epidemics which facilitates the spread of begomoviruses into and within and their transmission to\\nhost crops and from weed hosts. Increased populations of B. tabaci are associated conducive climatic\\nconditions. Epidemiological models suggest a high density of vectors can favour the evolution of higher\\nvirulence in virus populations. The disease incidence is less in late planted crop in all the cultivars due to\\nlower population of whitefly. The virus is also transmitted through seed tubers.\\nName of disease: GROUNDNUT BUD NECROSIS VIRUS (GBNV)\\nGeographical origin, distribution & Crop losses: GBNV, a Tospovirus, causes stem necrosis disease in potato\\n(PSND). Distribution of the tospovirus is worldwide. It is known to naturally infect potatoes from Argentina,\\nAustralia, Brazil and central India. Stem necrosis incidence was recorded up to 90% in some parts of Madhya\\nPradesh and Rajasthan and up to 50 % in Pantnagar . PSND is important in areas where thrips, the vector of\\nGBNV, and the virus sources occur together. It is rather common in early crop of potatoes in Central/\\nWestern plains and plateau regions of India. Losses up to 29 per cent have been reported by PSND.\\nSymptoms: Infected plants show extensive necrosis with formation of concentric rings or spots on leaves\\nand stems (Fig. 98). Shoots that are not killed have stunted/rosetted appearance and chlorotic necrotic ring\\nspots on leaves. Tubers on such plants may be few, sometimes small and rarely deshaped yet without the\\nvirus. Primary infection shows as necrotic spots or rings on youngest leaflets. The spots may have concentric\\nzonation and may be confused with early blight. Brown necrotic lesions develop on petioles and stems and\\nwithin the stem. Death of one or more stem tops may occur or, in extreme cases, the whole plant may die.\\nIn secondary infection, plants arising from infected tubers are stunted and exhibit bunching of leaves. The\\nleaflets are coarse and may desiccate and turn brown. Infected plants may appear normal or may show\\ndistortion or cracking but are usually small in size.\\nCausal organisms & Key characteristics: The virus has large roughly spherical, enveloped particles, ranging\\nfrom 70-110 nm in diameter, covered with knob-like surface projections. GBNV belongs to the genus\\nTospovirus in the family, Bunyaviridae.\\nFig. 97: Typical symptoms of\\nToLCNDV\\nPotato'),\n",

The symptoms always appear on the lower leaves of the\\ndiseased plants and are confined there, but in the potato variety Irish Chieftain, a pronounced brilliant\\nyellow mottle develops all over the plants. Tuber necrosis may also occur which starts from the heel end of\\nthe tuber and is favored by darkness arid high temperature. However, tubers from plants which develops\\nmild foliar symptoms after inoculation with different isolates of the virus, showed internal necrosis in\\nsome varieties.\\nCausal organisms & Key characteristics: PAMV is a single stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus with filamentous\\nparticles about 580 nm long and 11 nm wide and belongs to genus Potexvirus; family Alphaflexiviridae ;\\norder Tymovirales.

Later, it spread throughout the world through the introduction of late\\nblight resistant varieties from Europe. As of now, PCN has turned into a major pest in the largest part of\\npotato growing areas affecting >80 countries in the temperate, cooler parts of the tropical and subtropical\\nregions of the world and cause more than 70% yield losses. In India, Dr. F.G.W. Jones first detected the PCN\\nduring 1961 from Vijayanagaram farm in Udhagamandalam, The Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu and Tamil\\nNadu Government imposed domestic quarantine during 1971. Recently, the occurrence of this pest has\\nalso been reported from some parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand. Accordingly,\\nthe Government of India restricted the movement of potato seed tubers from the infested areas since\\n2018.\\nSymptoms: The disease caused by this nematode is often referred to as ‘potato sickness’. Slightly infested\\ncrop does not show any above ground symptoms. Howeve r, heavy infestation shows localized poor growth\\nof plants in small patches ( Fig. 99 ) and wilting during hot parts of the day. Severely infested plants remain\\nstunted with dull and unhealthy, as the season advances, the lower leaves turn yellow, brown and wither,\\nleaving only the young leaves at the top and ultimately causes the premature death of the plant. The root\\nsystem is poorly developed; the yield and size of the tubers are reduced considerably. Severely infested\\nplants give little or no harvest and we can see the\\npresence of white or yellow female nematodes\\nsticking to the roots.\\nCausal organism(s) & Key characteristics:\\na) G. rostochiensis : Second-stage juvenile (J2)\\nhas short body length, stylet knobs short with\\nprominent round, tail tapering to small with\\nrounded terminus.

M.\\nincognita  is common in the tropical regions\\nfollowed by M. javanica  and M. arenaria while\\nM. hapla, M. chitwoodi  and M. fallax are setup in\\ncooler climates and it causes >12.2% yield loss worldwide. The nematodes can interact with other soil-\\nborne fungus, bacteria, and viruses, causing significant crop loss.\\nSymptoms:  Stunting and yellowing of plants with chlorotic leaves, galls in roots, warty “pimple-like”\\nlesions on tubers, brown patches on flesh of the sliced tubers ( Fig. 101 ) and tuber deformation of potato\\ntubers. The most important RKN- Ralstonia solanacearum  interaction causes “pseudomonas wilt”.\\nCausal organism(s) & Key characteristics: The most widespread and economically important species in\\npotato are M. incognita , M. javanica , M. arenaria, M. hapla, M. chitwoodi , and  M. fallax . The sedentary\\nadult root-knot females are pearly white in colour. M. incognita, M. javanica, M. hapla and M. enterolobii\\nfemales are pear shaped without posterior protuberance but M. hapla has rough and irregular appearance.\\nM. fallax and M. chitwoodi has round body with short neck and slight posterior protuberance. Variations in\\nparineal patterns of Meloidogyne species are observed. In M. incognita, dorsal arch is high without lateral\\nlines while in M. javanica it is usually flattened with distinct lateral lines. In M. arenaria, dorsal arch is low\\nand rounded, dorsal striae slightly indented forming a shoulder on arch, lateral lines weakly visible; whereas,\\nin M. hapla dorsal arch is usually rounded with low dorsal arch, lateral lines clearly appeared. M. chitwoodi\\nand M. fallax possess round to oval dorsal arch, lateral lines weakly visible.\\nDisease cycle and favorable conditions: The J2s emerging from the egg masses begin feeding on the young\\npotato roots. Juveniles in the second stage (J2) moult and go through the J3 and J4 stages before becoming\\nadult females or males. Males are migratory and thread like, while adult females are sedentary, and pear\\nshaped. Males exit the root to find and mate with females. Females lay 200 to 1500 eggs in a gelatinous\\nmatrix, which commonly adhere to root galls. The length of the life cycle depends upon temperature,\\nduring the summer it complete the life cycle within 25-30 days whereas in the winter, it requires 65-100\\ndays to complete the same. The optimal temperature for development and reproduction ranges from 21-\\n27°C.\\nManagement\\n\\x99 RKN infestations can be reduced by using quality seed tubers, summer ploughing, field sanitization,\\nand keeping the field free from weeds.\\n\\x99\\n At least four-year crop rotation with non-host crops such as maize, wheat, oats, cotton, sorghum,\\ngrasses, Brassica  crops such as cabbage, cauliflower, mustard, Chinese cabbage and growing of\\nantagonistic crop (French marigold) in alternate rows with potato will reduce the RKN populations.\\nFig. 101:  Symptoms caused by root-knot nematode\\n(Meloidogyne spp.) on tubers'),\n",

The pre-emergence damping off and seed rotting are the usual causes of poor seedling stand.\\nThis type of damping off causes hidden loss but the post emergence damping off is a more serious problem.\\nSeedlings get infected near the soil line after emergence and colonized\\nby fluffy fungal growth.  The tissues become soft, water soaked and\\nweak causing the seedlings fall over and later they die.  The entire\\ndisease progress is so fast that leaves remain green, but they are\\nunable to stand further (\\nFig. 103 ).  Stem rot near collar region of\\nseedling is another severe problem observed mainly after 20 days of\\nseed emergence (\\nFig. 104). Damping off is caused by several species\\nof soil fungi where Rhizoctonia, Pythium , Fusarium , Phomopsis ,\\nSclerotium, are more or less associated with vegetable crops.\\nHowever, Rhizoctonia solani is most severe among all the pathogens.\\nBacterial leaf spot is second most important seedling disease of\\ntomato and chili. Symptoms appear as very minute, dark spots on\\nall above ground parts. Leaves turn yellow and blighted leaving only\\nstem (\\nFig. 105). Heavy soil, excessive rain, high soil moisture, dense\\nplanting, low light intensity and high dose of nitrogen favour seedling\\ndiseases.\\nManagement\\nManagement of damping off disease is only possible by integration\\nof physical, biological, cultural and chemical methods.\\nSoil solarization\\nSoil disinfestation using white transparent polythene in hot summer\\nis one of the most effective approaches for management of soil borne\\ndiseases particularly in nursery beds of high value horticultural crops\\nand greenhouse crops.  The main objective of soil solarization is to\\neliminate pathogens, weeds, toxic metabolites, biotic agents, insect\\netc. (\\nFig. 106 ).

Excellent control of bacterial blight to\\nthe tune of 55-60% of seedlings was recorded in solarized beds.  It also reduced the population of viable\\nsclerotia of S. rolfsii and Sclerotinia spp.  Soil solarization increases yield in corky root disease of tomato and\\nVerticillium wilt of brinjal. Availability of soil nutrients particularly phosphorus and potash are increased. Organic\\nmatter and cruciferous plants addition in nursery beds before polythene mulching have been found more\\neffective in reducing the cabbage yellows, Pythium spp and S. rolfsii.  Effect of\\nsolarization further increased when it was integrated with some selected\\npesticides and neem cake. For effective results, soil solarization performed on\\na tightly laid white plastic as close as possible on a smooth soil surface. The\\nedges must be tightly held by burying them in soil. Saturate the soil to at least\\n70 per cent of field capacity before or after laying plastic. The plastic should be\\nleft for 4-6 weeks to allow soil to heat to deeper depth.\\nBiological control\\nBiological seed treatment can be done by\\nseed priming, seed coating, seedling dipping,\\ndry powder treatments etc. depending upon\\nthe nature of biocontrol agents (\\nFig. 107 ).\\nGenerally, 6-10gram Trichoderma\\nformulation for one kg of seed is\\nrecommended for seed treatments but spore\\nconcentration of suspension should be 10\\n6\\nto 109/ml.  Similarly, 10-25 g powder should\\nbe applied in per m2 area depending upon of\\nthe soil type and organic matter.

Some Trichoderma\\nspp. is compatible to fungicides at lower doses of pencycuron, copper hydroxide, captan that may be integrated.\\nChemical control\\nThe easiest and most effective control measure f or vegetable damping off is to drench the nursery soil with\\ncaptan @0.25% solution.  Five-liter solution of this chemical should be uniformly applied in the 1x1 meter 2\\narea of nursery bed. After complete germination of all the seeds, copper oxychloride @0.25% should be sprayed\\nthoroughly in such a way that seedling and its root zone must be covered by the solution.\\nCultural method\\nNursery bed should be properly drained and pulverized. Soil texture of nursery bed should be light and porous\\nby adding equal proportion of sand and compost.  Sowing of seeds should be thin enough by maintaining\\nequilateral distance so that seedling will not be crowded.  Proper aeration and light to check damping off\\ninfection should be provided.  Protect germinating seeds and juvenile seedlings from heavy rain and scorching\\nsunlight through agronet, muslin cloth and portable low tunnel polythene arch.\\nNursery Diseases'),\n",
